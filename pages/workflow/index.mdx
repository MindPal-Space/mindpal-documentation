# Introduction to Multi-Agent Workflows

When it comes to complicated business processes with multiple steps, relying on a single AI agent often isn't enough to get quality results. That's where MindPal's multi-agent workflows come into play.

## What is a Multi-Agent Workflow?

A multi-agent workflow is a powerful automation system that connects several agents in a step-by-step process, enabling them to pass data and build upon each other's responses.

## When to Use Multi-Agent Workflows

While single agents excel at focused tasks, multi-agent workflows provide several key advantages:

1. **Higher Quality Output**: Specialized agents excel at specific tasks, leading to superior results when combined
2. **Easier Training**: Dividing tasks among agents leads to focused instructions and simplifies maintenance
3. **Flexibility**: Well-trained AI agents can be repurposed for various workflows, adapting to different processes

## Use Cases of Multi-Agent Workflows

Here's how different departments can leverage multi-agent workflows:
| Department | Use Cases |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Content Creation | • Blog Post Pipeline (Research → Write → Edit → Optimize)<br/>• Social Media Campaign (Ideation → Creation → Review → Schedule)<br/>• Video Script Generation (Research → Script → Edit → Format) |
| Customer Service | • Ticket Triage & Resolution<br/>• Customer Feedback Analysis<br/>• FAQ Generation & Updates<br/>• Support Documentation Creation |
| Data Processing | • Data Extraction & Transformation<br/>• Document Analysis Pipeline<br/>• Report Generation & Distribution<br/>• Data Quality Control |
| Business Operations | • Vendor Evaluation Process<br/>• Contract Review Pipeline<br/>• Project Planning Assistant<br/>• Resource Allocation Optimizer |

## Components of a Multi-Agent Workflow

A MindPal workflow consists of these core node types:

| [Agent](/workflow/build/agent-node)                             | A specialized agent focused on executing one specific task                | For focused, single-purpose operations                         |
| [Evaluator-Optimizer](/workflow/build/evaluator-optimizer-node) | Self-evaluates output and iteratively improves until meeting requirements | Quality control and optimization                               |
| [Loop](/workflow/build/loop-node)                               | Automatically performs a task across multiple items                       | Batch processing and scaling                                   |
| [Orchestrator-Worker](/workflow/build/orchestrator-worker-node) | Coordinates multiple worker agents for complex tasks                      | Autonomous planning and execution for unpredicatable processes |
| [Subflow](/workflow/build/subflow-node)                         | Runs another workflow within the current workflow                         | Modular and reusable process components                        |
| [Router](/workflow/build/router-node)                           | Switches between different paths based on logic                           | Conditional process branching                                  |
| [Gate](/workflow/build/gate-node)                               | Enforces stopping conditions to halt workflow                             | Quality and condition checkpoints                              |
| [Webhook](/workflow/build/webhook-node)                         | Sends workflow execution results to external systems                      | Integration with external tools                                |

## What Can You Do with a Multi-Agent Workflow?

### Run Workflows within Your Workspace

Workflows can be run in several flexible ways:

| Run Mode      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default       | Run workflows one set of inputs at a time with real-time results, making it perfect for individual tasks that need immediate feedback.                                                        |
| Supervised    | Run workflows with full control by reviewing and approving each step before proceeding, with ability to edit responses between steps - ideal for tasks that require constant human oversight. |
| In Background | Process workflows in the background while working on other tasks, with the flexibility to close the window and return later for results, suited for longer-running processes.                 |
| Bulk Run      | Process multiple workflow instances simultaneously by uploading batch inputs for parallel processing, with all results tracked conveniently in the workflow run result table.                 |

### Publish as a Form

# Running Workflows via Form

Share your workflows with anyone through an interactive form interface - no MindPal account required.

## What is a Workflow Form?

A workflow form transforms your complex multi-agent workflow into a simple, user-friendly web page where anyone can input data and get results. It's perfect for:

- Sharing workflows with clients or team members
- Embedding workflows on your website
- Creating public-facing AI tools
- Building workflow templates for others to use

## How It Works

When you publish your workflow as a form, it becomes publicly accessible to anyone who has the link or sees it embedded on a website. Users can input their data through the form interface and run the workflow to get results.

Every time someone runs your workflow through the form:

1. Their inputs are processed through your workflow
2. They receive the workflow results
3. The run is recorded in your workflow's "Run History" with "FORM" as the trigger type

## Configuring Your Workflow Form

Before publishing, make sure your workflow is:

- Successfully built and tested
- Generating the expected outputs
- Working reliably with different inputs

Then, navigate to the "Form" tab in your workflow to configure these sections:

### 1. Set Up the Identity

Give your workflow form a name and description.

- **Name** (required): Enter a clear name for your workflow
- **Description**: Add a rich-text description to explain what the form is for, what it does, how to use it, your contact information, or about you & your business. Use the AI-powered "Auto-generate" or "Enhance" button to create or improve your description automatically.

### 2. Customize the Interface

Personalize the visual appearance of your workflow form.

- **Icon**: Add a custom icon for your form (e.g., your company logo). Paste a public photo URL or upload an image.
- **Banner**: Add a header image for the form (e.g., product screenshot). Paste a public photo URL or upload an image.
- **Brand Color**: Choose a primary color for buttons and UI elements to match your brand.
- **MindPal Branding**: Toggle the "Powered by MindPal" badge visibility. Connect your affiliate code to earn 20% recurring commission.

### 3. Design the Workflow Experience

Control how users interact with your workflow.

#### Interaction Style

- **Enable Step-by-Step Human Review**: Pause after each step so the user can approve the AI's output before moving to the next step (similar to "Run in supervised mode" in app).
- **Show "Rerun" Button**: Allow users to reset the workflow and run it again from the beginning.
- **Enable Workflow Setup Template Duplication**: Allow others to clone this workflow setup into their own MindPal account (great for template creators).

#### User Capabilities

- **Allow "Retry" on Answers**: Let users ask the AI to try again if they aren't satisfied with a specific answer.
- **Allow Manual Editing**: Let users manually tweak or correct the text generated by the AI.
- **Enable "Copy to Clipboard"**: Add a quick-copy button next to every answer.
- **Enable PDF Download**: Add a button for users to download their final results as a PDF document.
- **Enable Social Sharing**: Add buttons for users to share their results directly to LinkedIn, X (Twitter), or Facebook.

#### Process Visibility

- **Control Which Steps Are Visible**: Toggle off any steps you want to run silently in the background. The user will only see "Running in background..." for hidden steps. Each workflow node can be toggled individually (some nodes are always visible or hidden by default).

### 4. Control Access

Manage who can access your workflow and how.

- **Public URL** (required): Your workflow will be available at `mindpal.space/[your-slug]`. Choose a unique URL path for your workflow.
- **Custom Domain** (optional): Host the form on your own domain.
- **Restrict Embedding to Specific Domains** (optional): Limit where your workflow can be embedded. Add specific domains (one per line) that are allowed to embed your workflow form. Example: `example.com`, `subdomain.example.com`.
- **Enable Custom User ID** (optional): Allow users to see their workflow run history by passing their user ID from your system. Choose one of three modes:

  - _None (Anonymous)_ - Default setting. All workflow runs are anonymous with no user identification required. Perfect for public workflows.

  - _Optional_ - Custom user ID can be passed to enable workflow run history per user. If no user ID is provided, workflow works normally (anonymous). Best for mixed audiences (some authenticated, some not).

  - _Required_ - Custom user ID must be passed or the workflow won't work. Always provides workflow run history. Only use this if the workflow is behind a login wall or in a members-only area.

  When enabled, you can pass a user ID from your website to MindPal, allowing users to access their workflow run history and continue from where they left off. See the [Custom User ID Guide](/guides/custom-user-id) for detailed implementation instructions.

### 5. Advanced

Configure advanced features to enhance your workflow.

#### Email Notifications

Get notified via email for each new submission when users submit workflow forms.

#### Rate Limiting

Enforce rate limits to control usage frequency. Set maximum number of conversations allowed and choose time interval: per minute, per hour, or per day.

#### Custom Session Context

Pass contextual information about users directly from your website to the workflow, enabling personalized AI interactions without requiring users to repeat information.

**How to Set Up:**

1. Toggle "Enable custom session context" to ON
2. Define context keys by adding custom fields:
   - **Label**: Human-readable name (e.g., "User ID", "Project Type")
   - **Generated Key**: Automatically created from the label in kebab-case format (e.g., "user-id", "project-type")

**How It Works:**

When enabled, you can pass information from your website to the workflow using the generated keys. All AI agents in the workflow will naturally use this information in their responses and decisions without explicitly mentioning where it came from.

**Example:**

If you define these context keys:

- Label: "Customer Type" → Key: `customer-type`
- Label: "Order ID" → Key: `order-id`

The workflow's AI agents will know the customer type and order ID, allowing them to provide tailored responses like generating order-specific reports or customizing outputs based on customer tier.

See the [Custom Session Context Guide](/guides/custom-session-context) for detailed implementation instructions on how to pass this data from your website.

## Sharing Your Workflow

Once configured, you have two options for sharing:

- **Direct Link**: Get a unique URL for your form and share it. Anyone with the link can access the form.
- **Embed Code**: Copy the embed code and paste it into your website as an iframe.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can users go back to previous steps in a workflow to make edits before moving to the next step?

Yes, enable "Step-by-step human review" in the "Design the workflow experience" section. When activated, the workflow will pause after each step, allowing users to review outputs, make edits, or regenerate results before proceeding to the next step.

### Is there a way to save progress in a workflow?

Yes, progress saving is built into the workflow system. When a user starts a workflow, a unique identifier called "workflow run ID" is generated and appears in the URL as a parameter. The URL would look something like this: `https://[YOUR_WORKFLOW_PUBLIC_URL]?wrid=[WORKFLOW_RUN_ID]`. As long as users save or bookmark this specific URL, they can return to it later and continue their workflow from where they left off. This is particularly useful for longer workflows with multiple input steps. You can also utilize webhooks to save the workflow run ID somewhere for your users, allowing them to access their workflow progress through your own system.

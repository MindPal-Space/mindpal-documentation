# Running Workflows via Form

When you're ready to share your workflow with audience or clients who don't necessarily need to have a MindPal account, you can publish it as an interactive form. This makes it easy for others to use your workflow without needing to understand the technical details.

## What is a Form?

A Form is a user-friendly interface that lets others interact with your workflow. It transforms your complex workflow into a simple web page where users can input data and get results - no technical knowledge required.

## How Workflow Form Works

When you publish your workflow as a form, it becomes publicly accessible to anyone who has the link or sees it embedded on a website. Users can input their data through the form interface and run the workflow to get results - all without needing a MindPal account.

Every time someone runs your workflow through the form:

1. Their inputs are processed through your workflow
2. They receive the workflow results
3. The run is recorded in your workflow's "Run History" with "FORM" as the trigger type

This lets you track and manage all form submissions while giving users a simple way to leverage your workflow.

## Configuring Your Form

Before publishing a workflow as a form, make sure your workflow is:

- Successfully built and tested
- Generating the expected outputs
- Working reliably with different inputs

Then, navigate to the "Form" tab in your workflow to access these key settings:

### Interface Settings

- **Icon URL**: Custom icon for your form (e.g., your company logo)
- **Banner URL**: Header image for the form (e.g., product screenshot)
- **Brand Color**: Primary color for buttons and UI (e.g., match your brand)
- **MindPal Branding**: Toggle MindPal logo visibility (e.g., hide for white-label forms)

### Copywriting

Add a rich-text description to your form. Things you can add:

- What the form is for
- What the form does
- How to use the form
- Your contact information
- About you & your business

### Access & Security

Control how others can access your workflow:

- **Custom Domain**: [Host the form on your domain](/workspace/custom-domain)
- **Embedding Controls**: Restrict which sites can embed
- **Rate Limiting**: Control usage frequency

## Sharing Your Form

You have two options for sharing:

1. **Direct Link**: Get a unique URL for your form and share it. Anyone with the link can access the form.

2. **Embed Code**: Copy the embed code and paste it into your website as an iframe.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can users go back to previous steps in a workflow to make edits before moving to the next step?

Yes, this is possible by enabling supervised mode in your form settings. Navigate to the "Functionality" tab in your Form settings and enable supervised mode. When this option is activated, the workflow will pause after each step, allowing users to review outputs, make edits, or regenerate results before proceeding to the next step.

### Is there a way to save progress in a workflow?

Yes, progress saving is built into the workflow system. When a user starts a workflow, a unique identifier called "workflow run ID" is generated and appears in the URL as a parameter. The URL would look something like this: `https://[YOUR_WORKFLOW_PUBLIC_URL]?wrid=[WORKFLOW_RUN_ID]`. As long as users save or bookmark this specific URL, they can return to it later and continue their workflow from where they left off. This is particularly useful for longer workflows with multiple input steps.

# Payment Node

Turn your workflows into a revenue stream by adding payment checkpoints. The Payment Node lets you monetize your expertise by requiring payment before users can access specific parts of your workflow.

## What is a Payment Node?

A Payment Node:

- Gates access to workflow steps until payment is completed
- Processes payments through your Stripe account
- Continues workflow automatically after successful payment

## When to Use a Payment Node?

Add a Payment Node when you want to monetize your workflow with a one-time payment.

## How Payment Nodes Work

When users reach a Payment Node in your workflow:

1. **Payment form**: A secure Stripe checkout form appears, requesting the one-time payment you configured
2. **Gated access**: Users cannot view or access any workflow steps after the Payment Node until payment is completed
3. **Secure processing**: All payments are processed securely through Stripe, connected directly to your account
4. **Full revenue**: You receive 100% of each payment - MindPal charges no platform fees or commissions (as of February 2025)
5. **Automatic continuation**: Once payment is successful, users gain immediate access to continue the workflow

## Configuring a Payment Node

### 1. Connect your Stripe to MindPal

Connect your Stripe account to your MindPal workspace by bringing your Stripe publishable key & secret/restricted key to the your workspace settings' "Keys & Credentials" tab.

Please make sure your credentials are correct, otherwise the payment will fail to be processed.

### 2. Set the price amount & currency

- Set amount
- Choose currency (USD, etc.)

# Webhook Node

If you need to send your workflow results to another system or app, the Webhook Node is the perfect tool for the job. It acts as a messenger that takes all the important information from your workflow, up to the point where the Webhook Node is added, and delivers it wherever you need it to go - whether that's a cross-app integration platform like Zapier or Make, your own backend, a third-party service, or any other system that can receive web requests.

## What is a Webhook Node?

A Webhook Node is a specialized component that:

1. Collects results from your workflow up to that point
2. Organizes the data in a consistent, structured format
3. Sends this information to your specified URL endpoint

This creates a bridge between your MindPal workflow and other systems, making it easy to integrate with your existing tools and services.

## When to use a Webhook Node?

Consider using the Webhook Node when:

- You need to send workflow results to another system
- You want to trigger actions in external applications
- You want to store or process workflow results elsewhere

Here are some common scenarios where Webhook Node excels:

| Scenario        | Example                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Collection | Sending customer info collected from a form to your CRM system |
| Integration     | Triggering actions in your backend when a workflow completes   |
| Automation      | Automatically updating external systems with workflow results  |
| Distribution    | Sending workflow outcomes to a third-party service to publish  |

## How a Webhook Node Works

The Webhook Node operates through a simple process:

1. Collects all workflow data up to the current point
2. Structures the data in a consistent JSON format
3. Sends a POST request to your specified webhook URL

The webhook will send data in this structured format:

```json
{
  "workflow_run_id": "string", // The ID of the workflow run
  "workflow_id": "string", // The ID of the workflow
  "workflow_title": "string", // The title of the workflow
  "workflow_run_input": [
    {
      "index": number, // The index of the input
      "title": "string", // The title of the input
      "type": "string", // The type of the input (e.g., "TEXT", "NUMBER", "DATE", "SELECT", etc.)
      "content": "string" // A stringified version of the input
    } // An array of all the inputs to the workflow up to the Webhook Node
  ],
  "workflow_run_output": [
    {
      "index": number, // The index of the output
      "title": "string", // The title of the output
      "type": "string", // The type of the node (e.g., "AGENT", "ORCHESTRATOR_WORKER", "LOOP", "EVALUATOR_OPTIMIZER", etc.)
      "content": "string" // A stringified version of the output
    } // An array of all the outputs from the workflow up to the Webhook Node
  ]
}
```

## Configuring a Webhook Node

One workflow can have multiple Webhook Nodes. To set up a Webhook Node, you need to configure these essential components:

### 1. Webhook URL Setup

The first and most important step is providing your webhook URL:

- Create a webhook URL in the destination system (e.g. Zapier, Make, your own backend, etc.)
- Enter the full URL where you want to receive the data

### 2. Testing Your Webhook

Before running your workflow:

- Use the "Send test data" button to verify your endpoint
- Check if your endpoint correctly receives and processes the data
- Verify the data format matches your expectations

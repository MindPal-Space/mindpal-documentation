# Gate Node

Need to make sure your workflow only proceeds when certain conditions are met? That's where the Gate Node comes in. It acts as a smart gatekeeper, evaluating conditions and deciding whether to let the workflow continue or stop it in its tracks - perfect for controlling costs and ensuring quality in your AI workflows.

## What is a Gate Node?

A Gate Node is a specialized component in MindPal's Multi-Agent Workflow that:

1. **Evaluates** specific conditions based on defined logic
2. **Decides** whether to allow the workflow to continue
3. **Stops** the workflow immediately if conditions aren't met

This creates an efficient system for controlling workflow progression and managing AI credit consumption.

## When to use a Gate Node?

Consider using the Gate Node when:

- You need to validate inputs before proceeding with expensive operations
- Quality checks are required before continuing the workflow
- Cost control is essential for your AI operations

Here are some common scenarios where Gate Node excels:

| Scenario         | Example                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input Validation | Ensuring all required information is valid before proceeding with complex processing            |
| Quality Control  | Checking if generated content meets specific quality criteria before proceeding to distribution |

## How a Gate Node Works

The Gate Node operates through a systematic process:

1. Receives input that needs to be evaluated
2. Uses the configured agent to assess the conditions
3. Makes a binary decision: continue or stop
4. Either allows the workflow to proceed or terminates it immediately

## Configuring a Gate Node

To set up a Gate Node, you need to configure these essential components:

### 1. Agent Selection

Choose the agent that will evaluate the conditions:

- Select an agent with appropriate analytical capabilities
- Ensure the agent understands your evaluation criteria
- Can be left blank if the evaluation is simple and doesn't require a specialized agent

### 2. Decision Logic Setup

Define the logic for the continuation decision:

- Specify clear conditions that must be met
- Write precise instructions for evaluation
- Use [variables](/workflow/build/variables) to reference inputs or previous node outputs if needed
- Include specific criteria for both continuation and termination

## Gate vs. Router Node

When dealing with workflow control based on conditions, you might wonder whether to use a Gate Node or a Router Node. Here's how to choose:

| When to use      | Gate Node                                                                                                                                                         | Router Node                                                                                                                                                         |

| Use Case Example | If you have a web page audit workflow that can process 2 types of pages (landing page and ecommerce product page), force stop if it doesn't belong to either type | Also a web page audit workflow, but you direct the input to different evaluation agents (one optimized for landing pages and the other for ecommerce product pages) |
| Impact           | Prevents unnecessary resource consumption by stopping early                                                                                                       | Optimizes performance by ensuring proper specialist handling                                                                                                        |

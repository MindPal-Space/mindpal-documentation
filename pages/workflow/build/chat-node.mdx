# Chat Node

In many workflow scenarios, you might need to have a conversation with an AI agent to get more details, clarify information, or explore a topic before moving on to the next steps. The Chat Node is designed for these situations, allowing for dynamic, interactive conversations within your workflow.

## What is a Chat Node?

A Chat Node is a component that facilitates a back-and-forth conversation between a human user and a designated AI agent. It pauses the workflow to allow for this interaction and then continues once the user decides to end the chat.

## When to use a Chat Node?

Consider using the Chat Node when:

- You need to conduct a consultation or discovery session with an AI.
- The workflow requires nuanced input that is best gathered through a conversation.
- You want to provide a user with an opportunity to ask questions or get help from an agent at a specific point in the workflow.
- You need to refine a query or instructions for a subsequent node through dialogue.

Here are some common scenarios where a Chat Node excels:

| Scenario                         | Example                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer Support**             | A workflow for troubleshooting an issue could use a Chat Node to allow the user to describe their problem in detail to a support agent.   |
| **Content Creation**             | Before drafting a blog post, a Chat Node can be used to brainstorm ideas and refine the outline with a creative agent.                    |
| **Sales & Marketing**            | A workflow for qualifying leads could use a Chat Node to ask a series of questions to a potential customer and gather their requirements. |
| **Personalized Recommendations** | A movie recommendation workflow could use a Chat Node to chat with the user about their preferences before suggesting movies.             |
| **Client Discovery**             | Before generating project deliverables, a Chat Node can be used to understand client requirements, goals and constraints in detail.       |

## How a Chat Node Works

The Chat Node operates through a systematic process:

1.  When a workflow execution reaches a Chat Node, it pauses.
2.  A chat interface opens up, initiated by a pre-configured first message from the selected agent.
3.  The user can then have a full conversation with the agent, sending and receiving messages.
4.  The user decides when the conversation is complete and clicks a button to "Finish conversation & Continue".
5.  The entire conversation history is saved as the output of the node, which can be referenced by subsequent nodes in the workflow.

## Configuring a Chat Node

To set up a Chat Node, you need to configure the following components:

### 1\. Agent Selection

You must choose an agent to handle the conversation.

- Click "Select an agent" to choose from your available agents.
- Pick an agent with expertise relevant to the conversational task.

### 2\. First Message Configuration

You need to set the initial message that the agent will send to start the conversation.

- In the "First Message" field, write the opening message.
- You can use variables to reference human inputs or outputs from previous nodes to make the message more contextual.

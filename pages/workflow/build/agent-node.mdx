# Agent Node

Throughout the workflow, if you have a task that can be assigned to an AI agent in your workspace, you can use agent nodes. They're the most basic building block for getting AI work done in your workflow.

## What is an Agent Node?

An Agent Node is simply a way to give a single task to one of your AI agents. Nothing complicated - just tell an agent what to do, and it'll do it. Each node focuses on one specific task in your workflow.

## How it Works

It's straightforward:

- The agent reads your instructions
- Uses any information you've provided from previous steps
- Does the task
- Gives you back the results

## Configuring an Agent Node

You'll need to set up two things:

1. **Agent** - You can leave this blank for general tasks (like categorizing or summarizing) or pick a specific agent from your agent library for specialized work.
2. **Prompt** - Tell the agent what to do. You can reference information from previous steps using [variables](/workflow/build/variables).

# Info Node

Running a workflow sometimes requires more than just processing data—you need to communicate with your users. Whether it's providing context before a critical step, explaining what's about to happen, or sharing important disclaimers, the Information Node is your way to pause and inform users before they continue.

## What is an Information Node?

An Information Node is a communication component that lets you:

1. Display formatted information to users during workflow execution

2. Provide context, instructions, or disclaimers at key moments

3. Ensure users acknowledge important information before proceeding

4. Guide users through complex workflows with helpful explanations

Think of it as a "heads up" moment in your workflow where you want to make sure users understand what's happening or what they need to know next.

## When to use an Information Node?

Consider using the Information Node when:

- You need to explain what happens in the next steps

- Users need to understand context before AI processes their input

- You want to provide instructions or guidelines

- Legal disclaimers or terms need to be acknowledged

- Complex workflows need explanatory text between steps

Here are some common scenarios where Information Node excels:

| Scenario             | Example                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instructions         | Explaining how to prepare documents before the AI analyzes them   |
| Context Setting      | Providing background information before content generation begins |
| Disclaimers          | Displaying legal notices or terms users need to acknowledge       |
| Process Transparency | Explaining what the AI will do in upcoming steps                  |
| Guidelines           | Sharing best practices or tips before user input collection       |

## How an Information Node Works

The Information Node operates through a simple process:

1. Displays formatted text content to the user during workflow execution

2. Pauses the workflow until the user clicks "Continue"

3. Records when the user acknowledged the information

4. Automatically proceeds to the next node without requiring supervisor approval (in supervised mode)

**Note:** Information Nodes are designed for guiding users during execution—they don't appear in PDF exports to keep the final output focused on results.

## Configuring an Information Node

Setting up an Information Node is straightforward:

### 1. Add Content

Use the rich text editor to create your information message:

- Format text with bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough

- Add headings and lists for better organization

- Include links to external resources

- Insert images if visual guidance is needed

- Create tables for structured information

### 2. Label the Node

Give your Information Node a clear, descriptive label that indicates what information it provides:

- "Processing Instructions"

- "Important Notice"

- "What Happens Next"

- "Terms & Conditions"

This helps you identify the node in the workflow builder and makes the workflow easier to maintain.

### 3. Placement

Position your Information Node strategically:

- **Before Human Input Nodes**: Provide instructions on what to enter

- **Before Complex Processing**: Explain what the AI will do

- **Between Major Workflow Sections**: Give context for the next phase

- **At Decision Points**: Help users understand their options

The Information Node works seamlessly in both manual and supervised run modes, ensuring users always see your message and explicitly acknowledge it before the workflow continues.

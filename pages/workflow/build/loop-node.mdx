# Loop Node

In many workflow scenarios, you'll find yourself needing to perform the same task multiple times with different inputs - like writing social media posts for multiple product features or analyzing feedback from different customers. The Loop Node is designed exactly for these situations, making it easy to process a list of items without creating redundant workflow steps.

## What is a Loop Node?

A Loop Node is a specialized component that automates repetitive tasks by:

1. Taking a list of items as input
2. Using a designated agent to process each item
3. Following specific instructions for handling each item

This creates an efficient system for handling multiple similar tasks without creating separate nodes for each item.

## When to use a Loop Node?

Consider using the Loop Node when:

- You have a list of similar items that need the same processing
- A task needs to be repeated multiple times with different inputs
- You want to automate repetitive operations
- You need to process data in batches
- You want to maintain consistency across multiple outputs

Here are some common scenarios where Loop Node excels:

| Scenario         | Example                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Creation | Processing a list of blog post ideas to generate full articles for each topic   |
| Social Media     | Creating LinkedIn posts for multiple product features or announcements          |
| Data Processing  | Analyzing customer feedback from multiple sources using the same criteria       |
| Documentation    | Generating documentation for multiple API endpoints following the same template |

## How a Loop Node Works

The Loop Node operates through a systematic process:

1. Extracts a list of items from some source, which can be a human input, a previous node output, or both
2. Processes each item individually using the configured agent with the same instructions

## Configuring a Loop Node

To set up a Loop Node, you need to configure these three essential components:

### 1. The List Setup

The first thing you'll see when creating a Loop Node is the "For each item in" field. This is where you specify your list of items to process. You can reference a human input or a previous node output via [variables](/workflow/build/variables). The system will automatically handle converting your input into a processable list.

### 2. Agent Selection

Next, you'll choose an agent to process each item in your list:

- Click "Select an agent" to choose from your available agents
- Pick an agent with expertise relevant to your task
- The same agent will process each item in your list

### 3. Instruction Configuration

In the "Task" field, write instructions for how the agent should process each item:

- Be clear and specific about what you want the agent to do
- Use [variables](/workflow/build/variables) to reference human inputs or previous node outputs if needed
- The system will automatically apply these instructions to each item in your list

### 4. Processing Limits

For workflow efficiency and resource management:

- Use the "Max items to process" slider to set a limit
- The default maximum is 10 items
- Adjust based on your needs while considering processing time and resources

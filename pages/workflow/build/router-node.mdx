# Router Node

Ever needed to send different types of tasks to different specialized agents? That's where the Router Node comes in. It acts like a smart traffic controller, examining each input and directing it to the most appropriate path for processing - ensuring that each type of task gets handled by the right specialist.

## What is a Router Node?

A Router Node is a specialized component in MindPal's Multi-Agent Workflow that:

1. **Examines inputs** based on defined decision logic
2. **Classifies** the input into distinct categories
3. **Directs** the flow to appropriate downstream agents

This creates an efficient system for handling diverse inputs while maintaining specialized processing for each type.

## When to use a Router Node?

Consider using the Router Node when:

- You have different types of inputs requiring different handling
- Different scenarios require different specialized agents

Here are some common scenarios where Router Node excels:

| Scenario                   | Example                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer Support           | Routing different types of support tickets (billing, technical, general inquiries) to specialized support agents |
| Content Processing         | Directing different content types (articles, social posts, documentation) to appropriate content specialists     |
| Job Application Processing | Routing different hiring decisions (acceptance, rejection) to appropriate post-decision actions                  |

## How a Router Node Works

The Router Node operates through a systematic process:

1. Receives an input that needs classification
2. Applies the configured decision logic to evaluate the input
3. Selects the appropriate path based on the evaluation
4. Directs the flow to the corresponding downstream node

## Configuring a Router Node

To set up a Router Node, you need to configure these essential components:

### 1. Decision Logic Setup

The decision logic is your classification criteria:

- Define clear instructions for how inputs should be evaluated
- Specify the conditions for selecting each path
- Ensure the logic covers all possible input scenarios
- Reference human input values or previous node outputs via [variables](/workflow/build/variables) if needed

### 2. Path Configuration

For each possible classification:

- Create a distinct path
- Specify the next node for that path
- Add a clear description of when this path should be taken

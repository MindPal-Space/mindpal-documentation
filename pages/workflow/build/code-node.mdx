# Code Node

When building workflows, you often need steps that execute precise, deterministic logic â€“ calculations, data transformations, or specific checks where you need a guaranteed outcome, unlike the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs). The Code Node is designed specifically for these scenarios.

## What is a Code Node?

The Code Node allows you to write and execute custom code snippets directly within your workflow. It provides a way to implement logic that requires accuracy and concrete execution, moving beyond the non-deterministic behavior of AI agents. Think of it as a specialized tool for tasks where predictability is key.

## When to use a Code Node?

Use the Code Node when your workflow requires:

- **Deterministic Logic**: Performing calculations, data formatting, or conditional checks that must produce the exact same output every time for the same input.
- **Precise Execution**: Implementing specific algorithms or business rules that cannot rely on the interpretive nature of an LLM.
- **Data Transformation**: Manipulating data from previous steps in a structured and predictable way before passing it on.
- **Custom Integrations**: Interacting with systems or APIs in a very specific manner defined by code (though Webhook Nodes are often preferred for standard API calls).

## How a Code Node Works

The Code Node executes your provided code snippet using the inputs you define and makes the results available as outputs for subsequent nodes in the workflow.

## Configuring a Code Node

Setting up a Code Node involves three main steps:

### 1. Define Inputs

Specify the data your code needs to run:

- Define input variables that your code script will use.
- You can map these inputs to outputs from previous nodes (like Agent Nodes or Human Input Nodes) or use static values. Use [variables](/workflow/build/variables) to reference outputs from preceding steps.

### 2. Write the Code

Write the script that performs your desired logic:

- Select the programming language (currently Python and JavaScript are supported).
- Write your code in the provided editor. Your code should process the input variables and prepare the desired output.

  **Important Note on Variables**: For simplicity, all input variables passed
  into the Code Node are treated as **strings**. You may need to parse or
  convert them within your code if you require other data types (e.g., numbers,
  booleans). It's recommended to primarily reference outputs from Agent Nodes or
  Human Input Nodes. While outputs from nodes like Orchestrator, Loop, or Gate
  can be referenced, they will be simplified into a string representation. **Use
  these complex node outputs with caution and test thoroughly before deploying
  to production.**

### 3. Define Outputs

Declare the variables that your code will produce:

- Specify the names of the output variables your script will generate.
- These outputs can then be referenced by subsequent nodes in the workflow using [variables](/workflow/build/variables).

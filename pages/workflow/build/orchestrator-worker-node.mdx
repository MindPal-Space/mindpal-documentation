# Orchestrator-Worker Node

Ever found yourself tackling a complex project where you're not quite sure about all the steps needed until you dig in deeper? That's exactly where the Orchestrator-Worker Node shines. Think of it as having a smart project manager (the orchestrator) who breaks down big tasks into smaller pieces and assigns them to specialized team members (the workers) - all while adapting the plan as new information comes to light.

## What is an Orchestrator-Worker Node?

The Orchestrator-Worker Node is a dynamic task planning & execution system that consists of:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: A central planner that breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
2. **Worker Agents**: Specialized agents that execute the individual subtasks

This creates a flexible system where complex tasks can be handled efficiently through intelligent task distribution and management.

## When to use an Orchestrator-Worker Node?

Consider using the Orchestrator-Worker Node when:

- The full scope of work isn't clear at the start
- Tasks require dynamic planning and adjustment
- Work can be broken down into smaller subtasks
- Different subtasks need different types of expertise

Here are some common scenarios where Orchestrator-Worker Node excels:

| Scenario         | Example                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Creation | Managing a content campaign where topics, formats, and distribution channels need to be planned and executed by different specialists       |
| Market Analysis  | Coordinating market research where questions to ask are not clear at the start and will be determined based on the product/service provided |

## How an Orchestrator-Worker Node Works

The Orchestrator-Worker Node operates through a systematic process:

1. The orchestrator agent analyzes the main task and creates an initial breakdown of subtasks as well as instructions for each subtask
2. The orchestrator agent assigns the subtasks to the appropriate worker agents
3. The worker agents execute their assigned tasks and report back

## Configuring an Orchestrator-Worker Node

To set up an Orchestrator-Worker Node, you need to configure these essential components:

### 1. Orchestrator Agent Setup

The orchestrator agent is your project manager:

- Select an agent with strong analytical and planning capabilities
- Provide clear instructions for the overall objective and for how tasks should be broken down with references to human inputs or previous node outputs via [variables](/workflow/build/variables) if needed

### 2. Worker Agents Selection

Choose your team of specialized workers:

- Select agents with different expertise relevant to potential subtasks

### 3. Execution Parameters

Set the operational parameters:

- Maximum number of subtasks to create

## Loop vs. Orchestrator-Worker Node

When dealing with tasks that involve multiple steps or items, you might wonder whether to use a Loop Node or an Orchestrator-Worker Node. Here's how to choose:
| When to use | Loop Node | Orchestrator-Worker Node |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| What you have | A list of similar items that need the same treatment | A big task that needs to be broken down into pieces |
| What you know | You know exactly what needs to be done for each item | You're not sure about all the steps needed at the start |
| Who does it | One agent can handle everything | You need different experts for different parts |
| Example | Given a list of topics, create a blog post for each topic by Blog Post Writer Agent | Given a blog post, repurpose it for different social media platforms, selected by the human at the time of execution, by a team of 10+ content creator agents|

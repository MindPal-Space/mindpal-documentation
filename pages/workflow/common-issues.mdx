# Common Issues in Workflows

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when building and running workflows in MindPal.

## Workflow Structure Issues

### 1. Multiple Starting Points

**Issue:** Your workflow won't run and shows an error about the starting point.

**Cause:** A workflow must have exactly one starting point - a node with no incoming connections. If you have multiple nodes without incoming edges, the workflow doesn't know where to begin.

**Solution:**
1. Review your workflow in the builder
2. Ensure only one node (typically a Human Input node) has no incoming connections
3. Connect any floating nodes to the main workflow chain

### 2. Disconnected Nodes

**Issue:** Some steps in your workflow are skipped during execution.

**Cause:** Nodes that aren't connected to the main flow won't execute.

**Solution:**
1. Check that all nodes are properly connected
2. Look for missing edges between nodes
3. Use the workflow preview to trace the execution path

### 3. Circular Dependencies

**Issue:** Workflow enters an infinite loop or fails with a dependency error.

**Cause:** A node references output from a node that comes after it, or nodes reference each other.

**Solution:**
1. Review variable references in each node
2. Ensure variables only reference nodes that execute BEFORE the current node
3. Reorganize the workflow to eliminate circular references

## Variable Issues

### 4. Variables Not Working

**Issue:** Variables show as plain text instead of being replaced with values.

**Symptoms:**
- You see `{{Variable Name}}` in the output instead of the actual value
- Agent responses mention the variable name literally

**Solutions:**
1. **Check variable highlighting** - Properly configured variables appear in purple
2. **Use the variable picker** - Click the "+" button to insert variables correctly
3. **Avoid manual typing** - Don't type variable syntax manually; always use the picker
4. **Verify variable exists** - The referenced node must exist and have output

### 5. Variable Contains Wrong Data

**Issue:** The variable value isn't what you expected.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check the source node** - Review what that node actually outputs
2. **Test the source node independently** - Run the workflow in supervised mode to inspect each step
3. **Verify the correct field** - Human Input nodes may have multiple fields

## Node Execution Issues

### 6. Agent Node Produces Poor Results

**Issue:** The agent within a workflow step gives unsatisfactory output.

**Solutions:**
1. **Improve the prompt:**
   - Be specific about what you want
   - Include context from previous steps using variables
   - Provide examples of expected output

2. **Use a better model:**
   - For complex tasks: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5
   - For reasoning: o3, o4 Mini

3. **Assign a specialized agent:**
   - Instead of using a blank/default agent, select one with appropriate system instructions and knowledge

### 7. Loop Node Processing Wrong Items

**Issue:** The loop doesn't iterate over the expected items.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify the list source prompt** - Ensure it correctly extracts items from the source
2. **Check the source format** - The AI needs clear, separable items
3. **Set appropriate max item count** - Start small (3-5) for testing
4. **Use explicit formatting** in the list source:
   ```
   Extract each product name from {{Previous Output}}, one per line.
   ```

### 8. Router Node Takes Wrong Path

**Issue:** The workflow goes down an unexpected branch.

**Solutions:**
1. **Review routing logic** - Make conditions clearer and more specific
2. **Add explicit criteria** in the prompt:
   ```
   If the sentiment is POSITIVE, choose path 1.
   If the sentiment is NEGATIVE, choose path 2.
   Otherwise, choose path 3.
   ```
3. **Test with various inputs** to verify all paths work correctly

### 9. Gate Node Blocks Unexpectedly

**Issue:** The Gate Node stops the workflow when it shouldn't, or continues when it should stop.

**Solutions:**
1. **Clarify the stopping condition:**
   ```
   Return TRUE (stop) if the input is empty or contains profanity.
   Return FALSE (continue) if the input is valid text.
   ```
2. **Use a smarter model** for nuanced condition evaluation
3. **Test edge cases** with various input types

## API and Trigger Issues

### 10. API Trigger Not Working

**Issue:** The workflow doesn't run when triggered via API.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify API format** - Match the exact schema in your workflow's API Reference tab
2. **Check authentication** - Ensure your API key is valid and included
3. **Validate JSON syntax** - Use a JSON validator to check your request body
4. **Check field names** - Names are case-sensitive

### 11. Webhook Node Fails to Send

**Issue:** The Webhook Node shows failed status.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify the URL** - Ensure it's correct and accessible
2. **Check endpoint availability** - Test with a tool like Postman
3. **Review authentication** - Add required headers
4. **Check payload format** - Some endpoints require specific formats

### 12. Scheduled Trigger Doesn't Fire

**Issue:** Workflows don't run at the scheduled time.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify schedule configuration** - Check timezone settings
2. **Ensure workflow is published** - Unpublished workflows won't trigger
3. **Check your plan** - Scheduled triggers require paid plans

## Performance and Credit Issues

### 13. High Credit Consumption

**Issue:** Workflows use more credits than expected.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use efficient models:**
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash (1 credit)
   - DeepSeek (0.5 credits)

2. **Optimize workflow structure:**
   - Combine steps where possible
   - Use Gate Nodes to stop early for invalid inputs
   - Set reasonable max items for Loop Nodes

3. **Monitor credit usage:**
   - Check the credit estimate in the workflow builder
   - Review actual consumption in completed runs

### 14. Workflow Times Out

**Issue:** Long-running workflows fail or timeout.

**Solutions:**
1. **Break into smaller workflows** - Use Subflow Nodes for complex processes
2. **Reduce loop iterations** - Process fewer items per run
3. **Use Background Mode** - For long workflows that don't need real-time results
4. **Optimize prompts** - Shorter, more focused prompts execute faster

## Debugging Tips

### Using Supervised Mode

1. Run the workflow in **Supervised Mode**
2. Review output at each step before proceeding
3. Edit or regenerate any problematic step
4. Identify exactly where issues occur

### Reading Error Messages

Error messages typically indicate:
- **Node name** - Which step failed
- **Error type** - What went wrong (context length, API error, etc.)
- **Suggested fix** - How to resolve the issue

### Testing Incrementally

1. Start with a simple workflow (2-3 nodes)
2. Verify each node works correctly
3. Add nodes one at a time
4. Test after each addition

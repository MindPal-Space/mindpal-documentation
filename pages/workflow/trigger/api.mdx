# Public API Trigger

import PageFooter from "components/PageFooter";

Imagine being able to kick off your workflows automatically from any system or application. That's exactly what the Public API trigger enables - it lets you programmatically start workflows through simple HTTP requests.

## What is it?

The Public API trigger is a powerful way to integrate MindPal workflows into your existing systems and applications. It provides a REST API endpoint that you can call to start a workflow execution with custom data.

## When to use it?

Use the Public API trigger when you want to trigger a workflow on MindPal to run programmatically from an external system or application, such as:

- A custom application you're building
- A cross-app integration platform like Zapier or Make

## How it works?

1. Send a POST request to the Public API endpoint with the workflow input data
2. The workflow starts executing with the provided data
3. You receive a response with the execution details

## Configuring the API request

The complete API documentation is available [here](https://api-v3.mindpal.io/docs).

For workflow-specific API details:

1. Open your workflow
2. Go to the "API Reference" tab
3. Find detailed documentation customized for your workflow's specific input schema

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  **Important:** The data provided in the API request must match the input
  schema of the workflow exactly. Follow the detailed documentation in the "API
  Reference" tab to ensure the request is correct.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I get the workflow run results?

Since workflows run asynchronously, when you trigger a workflow via the Public API, you'll immediately receive a workflow run ID rather than the final results. This is because workflows can take time to complete. There are two ways to get the workflow run results:

1. **Using Webhook Node (Recommended)**: Add a [Webhook Node](/workflow/build/webhook-node) at the end of your workflow. Once the workflow completes, it will automatically send all results to your specified webhook URL.

2. **Polling the Results API**: Use the workflow run result endpoint to retrieve results using the workflow run ID:

   ```
   GET /api/workflow-run-result/retrieve-by-id
   ```

   See the complete [API documentation](https://api-v3.mindpal.io/docs#/Results/get_workflow_run_by_id_api_workflow_run_result_retrieve_by_id_get) for details.

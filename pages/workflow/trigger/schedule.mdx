# Schedule Trigger

Ever wished your workflows could run on autopilot on a recurring basis, like having a reliable assistant who knows exactly when to kick off important tasks? That's exactly what Schedule triggers do - they let you automate your workflows to run at specific times, whether it's daily check-ins, weekly reports, or monthly analyses.

## What is a Schedule Trigger?

A Schedule trigger is a way to start your workflow at predetermined, recurring times. It acts like a smart alarm clock for your workflows, ensuring they run consistently without manual intervention.

## When to use a Schedule Trigger?

Use Schedule triggers when you want workflows to run automatically at specific times, such as:

- Daily morning briefings
- Weekly social media content planning
- Monthly performance report generation
- Periodic data backups
- Regular customer follow-ups

Here are some common scenarios where Schedule triggers excel:

| Scenario         | Example                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Planning | Trigger content ideation workflow every Monday morning   |
| Reporting        | Generate weekly analytics reports every Friday afternoon |

## How Schedule Triggers work

The Schedule trigger operates through a straightforward process:

1. You set up a schedule specifying when the workflow should run (e.g., every day at 9:00)
2. You configure the timezone to ensure the workflow runs at the right time for your location
3. You can optionally set up human input that will be used each time the workflow runs
4. At the scheduled time, the workflow automatically starts with the configured input

## Configuring a Schedule Trigger

To set up a Schedule trigger, you need to configure these essential components:

### 1. Schedule Setup

First, define when your workflow should run:

- Choose the frequency (every day, week, month)
- Set the specific time
- Select your timezone to ensure accurate timing

### 2. Human Input Configuration

If your workflow needs specific input each time it runs:

- Define the input fields your workflow needs
- The input will be used consistently for each scheduled run
- You can modify these inputs anytime by editing the trigger

Did you know you can set up multiple schedules for a single workflow? This means you can:

- Run the same workflow at different times (e.g., daily at 9am and 5pm)
- Use different input data for each schedule (e.g., different prompts for content generation)
- Manage each schedule separately without affecting others
- Adapt one workflow for multiple use cases (e.g., generate reports for different teams)

For example, you could have a content creation workflow that runs daily at 9am to create blog posts, and again at 2pm to create social media content - each with its own specific inputs and parameters.

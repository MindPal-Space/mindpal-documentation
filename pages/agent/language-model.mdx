# Language Model Settings

AI agents need powerful language models to understand and respond to requests. But different tasks require different levels of capability - a simple chatbot might only need basic comprehension, while a complex analysis tool needs advanced reasoning. That's where language model settings come in - they let you choose and configure the AI engine that powers your agent, ensuring you get the right balance of performance and efficiency for your specific needs.

## What are Language Model Settings?

Language model settings control which AI model powers your agent and how it works, directly affecting the quality, speed, and cost of your agent's responses.

Every agent needs a language model to work.

## How Language Model Settings Work

When you run an agent, your request is processed according to your chosen model and settings to generate the most appropriate response for your needs.

## Configuring Language Model Settings

### 1. Choose a Model

  If you don't pick a model, we'll use a default model (currently GPT-4o Mini). See [AI Credits](/workspace/ai-credit) for credit costs per model.

#### How to Choose a Model

Consider these rules of thumbs when selecting a model:

1. **Check Model Capabilities**

   Make sure the selected model's capabilities match the requirements of the agent's job. Look for these key features in the model tooltip:
   | Parameter | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Context window | How much information the model can process at once, including your input and its memory of the conversation |
   | Maximum output length | The longest response the model can generate in a single turn |
   | Image processing ability | Whether the model can understand and analyze images you provide |
   | Tool usage support | Whether the model can use external tools provided in the "Tools" settings of your agent |

2. **Don't Overkill**

   For simple tasks, cost-effective models are often sufficient:
   - **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (1 credit) - Excellent for most tasks
   - **DeepSeek V3/R1** (0.5 credits) - Great for coding and reasoning
   - **GPT-5 Mini** (3 credits) - Balanced quality and cost

   Reserve premium models (Claude Opus 4.5, o3) for complex reasoning tasks.

3. **Consider Model Strengths**

   If multiple models meet your requirements, consider their unique strengths:

   | Model Family                 | Key Strengths                                                                                               |
   | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | OpenAI (GPT-5, o3)           | • Excellent at following instructions<br/>• Consistent output quality<br/>• Strong at structured data tasks |
   | Anthropic (Claude)           | • Superior coding abilities<br/>• Nuanced writing and analysis<br/>• Great at technical documentation       |
   | Google (Gemini)              | • Massive context windows (1M+ tokens)<br/>• Strong reasoning capabilities<br/>• Powerful visual understanding |
   | DeepSeek                     | • Extremely cost-effective (0.5 credits)<br/>• Excellent for coding tasks<br/>• Strong reasoning            |
   | Perplexity (Sonar)           | • Built-in web search<br/>• Real-time information<br/>• Research-focused                                    |
   | Groq (LLaMa, Kimi)           | • Very fast responses<br/>• Cost-effective<br/>• Good for general tasks                                     |

### 2. Set Maximum Output Length

Control how long your agent's responses should be by setting the maximum output tokens.

For your reference, 1,000 tokens is about 750 words.

If you don't set a specific value and use "Auto", the model will adjust the length based on what you're asking it to do.

### 3. Control Creativity Level

Adjust how creative your agent's responses are by setting the temperature.

The higher the temperature, the more varied and creative the model's responses will be. Good for brainstorming and creative work.

The lower the temperature, the more consistent and predictable the model's responses will be. Good for fact-based tasks.

Pick "Auto" and the model will adjust creativity based on your task.

# Introduction to Agents

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a specialized AI assistant trained to excel at a specific task or domain. Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots, MindPal agents are:

- **Task-focused**: Trained to handle specific jobs with expertise

## When to Use an Agent

The key to success with AI agents is giving them **specific, focused jobs**. Instead of creating one agent to "handle marketing", it's better to create separate agents for:

- Writing social media posts
- Analyzing campaign metrics
- Generating email newsletters
- Creating ad copy

This focused approach ensures each agent:

- Maintains high quality output
- Stays within its area of expertise
- Can be optimized for specific tasks
- Is easier to train and maintain

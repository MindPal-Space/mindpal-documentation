<Callout emoji="💡" type="warning">
  While it's gaining significant support, MCP is still in its early stages. We
  strongly recommend **thoroughly testing** any MCP integration within the
  MindPal app first. Be careful when deploying MCP connections in published
  agents or workflows.

## What is MCP?

[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol, initiated by Anthropic, that standardizes how AI agents connect with external data, tools, and services.

Think of it like a **USB-C port for your AI agent**. Normally, connecting an AI agent to external tools (like reading data from Google Drive or triggering actions in other apps) requires complex, time-consuming setup, especially if you're not a technical expert.

MCP simplifies this dramatically. Different providers offer **MCP servers**, which act like USB-C hubs packed with specific data or tools. You can "plug" one of these servers into your MindPal agent using just a single URL. Instantly, your agent gains access to everything offered by that server – no complicated configuration needed.

## Why use MCP?

MCP offers several key benefits:

- **Simple Integration**: Connect your AI agents to external tools with just a URL, eliminating complex coding or setup.
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Give your agents access to a much wider range of data and functionality from external sources.
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Build more powerful and efficient automated processes by letting agents interact with other apps and services.
- **Better Context**: Allow agents to understand and work with your specific data and tools more effectively.

Given MCP's transformative potential, MindPal proudly leads as the **first no-code AI agent platform** to integrate this technology, democratizing access to these advanced capabilities for all users.

## MCP Support in MindPal

It's important to know what MindPal currently supports regarding MCP:

- **Tools Only**: An MCP server can potentially offer various things like Resources, Prompts, or Sampling Routes. Right now, MindPal only supports **Tools** provided by MCP servers.
- **Streamable HTTP/SSE Servers Only**: MCP servers can operate in different ways. MindPal supports **Streamable HTTP** and **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** servers, which are suitable for cloud-based applications like ours. We do not support STDIO servers, which are typically used for local integrations.

## How to configure MCP in MindPal

Setting up an MCP connection in MindPal is straightforward:

1.  **Find a remote MCP Server**: Locate a server that provides the tools your agent needs. See the list below for some compatible options.
2.  **Navigate to Agent Settings**: Go to the settings page for the AI agent you want to configure.
3.  **Go to the MCP Section**: Find the section dedicated to MCP connections.
4.  **Add Server**: Click on "Add new remote MCP server".
5.  **Enter Details**: Paste your MCP server URL and give the connection a recognizable name.
6.  **Save & Test**: Save the configuration. MindPal will automatically test the connection to verify that the server is reachable and configured correctly, and to retrieve the list of available tools.

That's it! Your AI agent is now ready to use the tools provided by the connected MCP server. It really just takes a URL.

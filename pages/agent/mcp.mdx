MCP is currently in beta and support for web platforms like MindPal is limited. While you can use MCP in MindPal, we recommend:
- Thoroughly testing MCP functionality in a development environment first
- Being cautious when deploying MCP in published agent/workflow

## Why use MCP?

MCP offers several key benefits:
- **Simplified Integration**: Connect your AI agents with external tools without complex coding
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Give your agents access to a wider range of data and functionality

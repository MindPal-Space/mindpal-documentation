# Sub-agent

Sub-agent is a feature in MindPal that enables agents to delegate tasks to other specialized agents. This hierarchical delegation system allows you to build more robust and scalable agent workflows.

## What is a sub-agent?

A sub-agent is an agent that works under another agent (parent agent) to handle specific tasks. The parent agent can delegate tasks to its sub-agents based on their expertise and capabilities.

## How it works

When a parent agent receives a task, it can:
1. Analyze the task requirements
2. Identify which sub-agent is best suited for the task
3. Delegate the task to the appropriate sub-agent
4. Collect and process the results from the sub-agent

To configure sub-agents for an agent in MindPal:
1. Open the agent settings
2. Navigate to the sub-agent tab at the bottom
3. Select the agent you want to confifure as the sub-agent

## Real-world example

Let's say you have a social media management system with the following structure:

```
General Manager Agent
└── Social Media Manager Agent
    ├── LinkedIn Post Agent
    ├── Twitter Post Agent
    ├── Facebook Post Agent
    └── Instagram Post Agent
```

Here's how it works in practice:

1. A user asks the General Manager Agent to "Create a social media campaign for our new product launch"
2. The General Manager Agent delegates this to the Social Media Manager Agent
3. The Social Media Manager Agent:
   - Creates a campaign plan
   - Delegates specific tasks to specialized agents:
     - LinkedIn Post Agent writes professional posts
     - Twitter Post Agent creates engaging tweets
     - Facebook Post Agent designs Facebook content
     - Instagram Post Agent develops visual content

## Benefits

# Composio Integrations

Composio enables your MindPal agents to connect with 100+ external applications and services through secure OAuth authentication. This allows your agents to perform actions in tools like Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, Notion, and many more.

## What is Composio?

Composio is an integration platform that provides:
- **Secure OAuth connections** to third-party apps
- **Pre-built actions** for common tasks
- **Fine-grained control** over what each agent can do

Unlike [MCP integrations](/agent/mcp) which use the Model Context Protocol, Composio uses traditional OAuth authentication and provides a curated set of actions for each application.

## How Composio Works

1. **Connect an app** - Authenticate with the service using OAuth
2. **Select allowed actions** - Choose which specific actions your agent can perform
3. **Agent uses actions** - During conversations, the agent can execute allowed actions

## Setting Up Composio Integrations

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Open your agent's settings
2. Find the **"Integrations"** or **"Composio"** section
3. Click **"Connect an app"** or **"Add integration"**

### Step 2: Choose an Application

Browse the integration marketplace to find the app you want to connect:

**Popular Integrations:**

| Category | Applications |
|----------|-------------|
| **Communication** | Gmail, Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams |
| **Productivity** | Google Calendar, Google Drive, Notion, Airtable |
| **Project Management** | Trello, Asana, Jira, Linear |
| **CRM & Sales** | HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive |
| **Marketing** | Mailchimp, SendGrid, ConvertKit |
| **Developer** | GitHub, GitLab, Vercel |
| **E-commerce** | Shopify, Stripe, Square |
| **Social** | LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook |

### Step 3: Authenticate

1. Click **"Connect"** on your chosen app
2. A popup window opens for authentication
3. Log in to the service and authorize MindPal
4. The popup closes automatically when complete

### Step 4: Select Allowed Actions

After connecting, choose which actions your agent can perform:

**Example actions for Gmail:**
- Send email
- Read emails
- Search emails
- Create draft
- Reply to email

**Example actions for Slack:**
- Send message to channel
- Send direct message
- Read channel messages
- Create channel

  Only enable actions that your agent actually needs. This follows the principle of least privilege and keeps your integrations secure.
</Callout>

## Using Integrations in Agents

Once connected, your agent can automatically use the integrations when needed. You can guide usage through system instructions:

```
You have access to Gmail integration. When the user asks to send an email:
1. Confirm the recipient and subject with the user
2. Draft the email content
3. Send the email using the Gmail integration
4. Confirm successful delivery
```

## Managing Connections

### Viewing Connected Apps

1. Go to your agent settings
2. Open the **Integrations** section
3. View all connected apps and their status

### Modifying Allowed Actions

1. Click on a connected integration
2. Enable or disable specific actions
3. Save your changes

### Disconnecting an App

1. Click on the connected integration
2. Click **"Disconnect"** or **"Remove"**
3. Confirm the disconnection

This removes MindPal's access to that service. You'll need to reconnect and re-authenticate to use it again.

## Composio vs MCP

Both Composio and MCP let agents connect to external services, but they work differently:

| Feature | Composio | MCP |
|---------|----------|-----|
| **Authentication** | OAuth (per user) | Server URL (shared) |
| **Setup Complexity** | Click to connect | Requires server URL |
| **Action Control** | Select allowed actions | All server tools available |
| **Best For** | Common SaaS apps | Custom/specialized tools |
| **User-Specific** | Yes (your credentials) | No (shared server) |

**When to use Composio:**
- Connecting to popular SaaS applications
- Need user-specific authentication
- Want fine-grained action control

**When to use MCP:**
- Using automation platforms (Zapier, Make)
- Need custom tools or servers
- Sharing tools across all users

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Limit Actions
Only enable actions your agent actually needs. If your agent only needs to read emails, don't enable "send email."

### 2. Review Regularly
Periodically review connected integrations and remove ones you no longer use.

### 3. Use Specific Agents
Create dedicated agents for specific integrations rather than giving one agent access to everything.

### 4. Test Before Production
Test integrations in a controlled environment before deploying them in published chatbots or workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Ensure pop-ups are enabled for the authentication window
- Check if the service requires additional permissions

### Actions Not Working
- Verify the action is enabled in your integration settings
- Check if your service account has permission for that action
- Review rate limits on the external service

### Authentication Expired
- Some services require periodic re-authentication
- Disconnect and reconnect the integration if you see auth errors

## Example Use Cases

### Customer Support Agent with Gmail

```
Agent: Customer Support Assistant
Integrations: Gmail (read, reply)

System Instructions:
"When a customer asks about their order, search their email history
to find relevant order confirmations and shipping updates. Use this
information to provide accurate support."
```

### Project Manager Agent with Multiple Tools

```
Agent: Project Coordinator
Integrations:
- Slack (send messages)
- Asana (create tasks, update status)
- Google Calendar (check availability, create events)

System Instructions:
"Help coordinate projects by creating tasks in Asana, scheduling
meetings in Google Calendar, and notifying team members in Slack."
```

### Social Media Agent with LinkedIn

```
Agent: LinkedIn Content Creator
Integrations: LinkedIn (create post)

System Instructions:
"Help users craft and publish professional LinkedIn posts. Always
show the draft for approval before posting."
```

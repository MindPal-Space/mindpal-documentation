# Brand Voice

AI agents are trained on general data, which means they naturally communicate in a neutral, standardized way. This can feel disconnected from your brand's unique personality and communication style. Brand voice settings let you customize how your AI agents communicate, ensuring they match your company's tone - whether that's friendly and conversational, professional and authoritative, or anything in between.

## What is Brand Voice?

Brand voice is how your company speaks to your audience - it's the consistent tone and style that makes your communications recognizable. When you apply this to AI agents, they'll generate content that matches your company's communication style.

## How Brand Voice Works

Here's the practical process:

1. You create brand voice guidelines
2. These guidelines get added to your agent's system prompt
3. Every time your agent writes something, it follows these guidelines

It's that simple - your agent will automatically match your brand's style in every response.

## Configuring Brand Voice

### Creating a Brand Voice

You can set up different voices for different purposes:

- Casual voice for social media
- Professional voice for business documents
- Sales voice for marketing materials

Here's how to create one:

1. Go to "Assets" â†’ "Brand Voices"
2. Click "Create new brand voice"
3. Name it based on its purpose (e.g., "Blog", "Social", "Technical")
4. Upload example content that shows your desired style:
   - Blog posts
   - Social media content
   - Marketing copy
   - Any content that represents your target style

MindPal will analyze these examples and create guidelines automatically. You can adjust these guidelines anytime to fine-tune the voice.

### Connecting Brand Voice to Agents

Simply go to your agent settings and assign the brand voice you want. You can use the same brand voice for multiple agents if needed.

## Best Practices

### Choosing Good Examples

For best results:

- Use 3-5 high-quality examples
- Include examples that cover your full style range
- Use recent content that reflects your current brand

### Different Voices for Different Channels

Create separate voices for each communication channel:

- LinkedIn/Business emails: Professional and authoritative
- Social media: Casual and engaging
- Documentation: Clear and helpful
- Customer support: Friendly and solution-focused
- Marketing: Persuasive and action-oriented

This ensures your AI communications are appropriate for each platform while maintaining your brand identity.

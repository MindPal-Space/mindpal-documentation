# Brand Voice

AI agents are trained on general data, which means they naturally communicate in a neutral, standardized way. This can feel disconnected from your brand's unique personality and communication style. Brand voice settings let you customize how your AI agents communicate, ensuring they match your company's tone - whether that's friendly and conversational, professional and authoritative, or anything in between.

## What is Brand Voice?

Brand voice (also called Brand Guidelines) is how your company speaks to your audience - it's the consistent tone and style that makes your communications recognizable. When you apply this to AI agents, they'll generate content that matches your company's communication style.

A brand voice typically includes:
- **Tone and formality** - Casual, professional, friendly, authoritative
- **Writing style** - Sentence structure, vocabulary choices, literary devices
- **Target audience alignment** - How you speak to your specific audience
- **Brand values integration** - How your core values come through in communication

## How Brand Voice Works

Here's the practical process:

1. You create brand voice guidelines
2. These guidelines get added to your agent's system prompt
3. Every time your agent writes something, it follows these guidelines

It's that simple - your agent will automatically match your brand's style in every response.

## Configuring Brand Voice

### Creating a Brand Voice

You can set up different voices for different purposes:

- Casual voice for social media
- Professional voice for business documents
- Sales voice for marketing materials

Here's how to create one:

1. Go to **"Assets"** → **"Brand Guidelines"** (or "Brand Voices")
2. Click **"+ Create"** or **"Create new brand voice"**
3. Choose your creation method:

#### Option 1: AI-Generated (Recommended)

Let AI analyze your existing content and generate comprehensive guidelines:

1. Click **"Generate with AI"**
2. Provide a brand description OR paste sample content that represents your desired style
3. MindPal will analyze and generate a detailed brand voice analysis including:
   - Tone and formality characteristics
   - Writing style elements
   - Target audience alignment
   - Brand values integration
   - Recommendations for maintaining the voice
4. Review and adjust the generated guidelines as needed

#### Option 2: Manual Creation

Create guidelines from scratch:

1. Click **"Start from scratch"**
2. Enter a **Title** (e.g., "Blog Voice", "Social Media", "Technical Documentation")
3. Write your **Description** with detailed guidelines
4. Add **Categories** to organize your brand voices

### Brand Voice Fields

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Title** | Name for the brand voice (e.g., "Casual Social Media") | Yes |
| **Description** | Detailed guidelines for tone, style, and communication approach | Yes |
| **Categories** | Tags to organize and filter brand voices | No |

### Connecting Brand Voice to Agents

1. Open your agent's settings
2. Navigate to the **Brand Voice** section
3. Select the brand voice you want to apply
4. Save your changes

You can assign the same brand voice to multiple agents, ensuring consistent communication across your AI team.

## Best Practices

### Choosing Good Examples

For best results:

- Use 3-5 high-quality examples
- Include examples that cover your full style range
- Use recent content that reflects your current brand

### Different Voices for Different Channels

Create separate voices for each communication channel:

- LinkedIn/Business emails: Professional and authoritative
- Social media: Casual and engaging
- Documentation: Clear and helpful
- Customer support: Friendly and solution-focused
- Marketing: Persuasive and action-oriented

This ensures your AI communications are appropriate for each platform while maintaining your brand identity.

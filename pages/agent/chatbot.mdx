# Chatbots

So far, we've discussed how to build powerful AI agents with custom knowledge and capabilities. But what if you want to share your agent so anyone can use it, even without a MindPal account? That's where chatbots come in.

## What are Chatbots?

Chatbots are the publishable version of your AI agents. They provide a user-friendly chat interface that allows anyone to interact with your agent's capabilities. Think of it as turning your agent into a public-facing service that can be:

- Embedded on your website
- Shared via a public link
- Accessed through a chat bubble
- Hosted on your custom domain

## How Chatbots Work

When you publish an agent as a chatbot:

1. **Interface Layer**: Your agent gets wrapped in a customizable chat interface
2. **Public Access**: Users can interact without needing a MindPal account
3. **Secure Processing**: All interactions are still powered by your configured agent
4. **Data Collection**: Optional user information can be gathered
5. **Usage Tracking**: All conversations can be monitored and analyzed

One agent can be published as multiple chatbots, each with its own unique interface and settings.

### Set Up the Chatbot Interface

Navigate to the chatbot tab to configure these settings:

#### 1. General Information

- **Name**: Give your chatbot a clear, identifiable name
- **Avatar URL**: Add a profile picture (supports image URLs)
- **Tags**: Organize your chatbots with relevant tags
- **Description**: Explain what your chatbot can help with

#### 2. Functional Settings

- **Agent**: Select the AI agent that will power this chatbot
- **Notifications**: Toggle to receive alerts when new chats are created

#### 3. User Info Collection

- Enable/disable user information collection
- Configure custom fields:
  - Field title (e.g., "First name", "Email")
  - Field type (Text, Email, etc.)
  - Required/Optional status
- Option to send collected data to a webhook

#### 4. Chat Interface

- **Branding**: Option to hide MindPal branding
- **Brand Color**: Customize the chat interface colors
- **Initial Message**: Set a welcome message (e.g., "Hi there! How can I help you today?")
- **Message Suggestions**: Add clickable suggestions for users
- **UX Copywriting**: Customize the chat interface copywriting like the submit button text, placeholder text, and more

#### 5. Access & Security

- **Custom URL**: Get a unique chatbot URL (chatbot.mindpal.space/your-chatbot)
- **Custom Domain**: Option to [use your own domain](/workspace/custom-domain)
- **Embedding Restrictions**: Limit which domains can embed your chatbot
- **Rate Limits**: Set maximum conversations per user/minute

### Using Webhooks with User Info Collection

When you enable user information collection, you can connect a webhook to automatically receive this data in your external systems.

#### How Webhooks Work

1. **Setup**: Provide a webhook URL from services like Make.com, Zapier.com, or any automation platform
2. **Triggering**: When a user submits the info collection form, MindPal automatically sends the data to your webhook
3. **Data Format**: The webhook receives a structured payload containing:

```json
{
  "chatbotId": "<YOUR_CHATBOT_ID>",
  "chatbotConversationId": "<CURRENT_CHATBOT_CONVERSATION_ID>",
  "chatbotConversationViewUrl": "<CURRENT_CHATBOT_CONVERSATION_VIEW_URL>",
  "userInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "company": "Acme Inc"
  } // The actual user info object would vary based on your form structure
}
```

### Deploy & Share

After configuring, you can:

- Copy your public chatbot link
- Get embed code for iframe implementation
- Add chat bubble widget code to your website
- Connect your custom domain

### View Conversation Logs

Monitor your chatbot's performance through the logs section:

- View complete chat histories

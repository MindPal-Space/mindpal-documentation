# System Instructions

Out of the box, AI agents are generalists - they can engage in conversation but lack specific focus or consistent behavior patterns. What if you want your agent to be a dedicated customer service expert who always maintains a friendly tone? Or a technical specialist who follows strict protocols? That's where system instructions come in - they transform general-purpose AI into focused, reliable assistants that consistently follow your rules and guidelines.

## What are System Instructions?

Think of system instructions as the "operating manual" for your AI agent - they determine everything from how it processes information to how it responds to requests.

Unlike one-time commands or chat-specific instructions, system instructions create a consistent personality and behavior pattern that persists across all interactions.

## How System Instructions Work

When you run an AI agent on MindPal, the system instructions become the `system prompt` for the AI model. This system prompt is consistently maintained throughout all interactions with the agent, whether you're:

- Chatting with the agent individually
- Running the agent as part of a multi-agent workflow
- Using the agent across different sessions

## Configuring System Instructions

In MindPal, system instructions are divided into two main sections:

### 1. Background

This section defines who your agent is and what it is supposed to do. Include information such as:

- **Role and identity**: e.g., "You are an experienced content strategist"
- **Behavioral guidelines**: e.g., "You communicate in a friendly yet professional manner"
- **Task parameters**: e.g., "You always start by understanding the target audience"
- **Knowledge boundaries**: e.g., "You have deep knowledge of SEO best practices"
- **Tool usage guidelines**: e.g., "You must use both Tavily and Exa Search tools at once" or "You must break down your search with Tavily tool in multiple search queries"

### 2. Desired Output Format

This section specifies how your agent should structure its responses. You can define:

- **Response structure**: How information should be organized
- **Required components**: What must be included in each response
- **Formatting preferences**: How to present different types of information
- **Specific templates**: Any standardized formats to follow
- **Output constraints**: Any limitations on response length or content

## Best Practices

### Do's ✓

- **Be specific**: Define clear, unambiguous instructions
- **Stay focused**: Keep the agent's purpose narrow and well-defined
- **Include examples**: Provide sample scenarios and desired responses
- **Set boundaries**: Clearly outline what the agent should not do
- **Update regularly**: Refine instructions based on performance

### Don'ts ✗

- **Avoid contradictions**: Don't give conflicting instructions
- **Don't be vague**: Unclear instructions lead to inconsistent performance
- **Don't overload**: Too many instructions can confuse the agent
- **Don't assume knowledge**: Explicitly state required information
- **Don't skip testing**: Always verify how instructions affect behavior

Remember: Well-crafted system instructions are the foundation of a high-performing AI agent. Take time to design, test, and refine them for optimal results.

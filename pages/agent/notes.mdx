# Notes

Notes are a powerful way to store persistent information that your AI agents can access and remember. Unlike knowledge sources (which are typically documents and files), notes are dynamic, easily editable content that serves as your agent's long-term memory.

## What are Notes?

Notes are text-based knowledge entries that you create and manage within MindPal. They function as a persistent memory layer for your AI agents, allowing them to:

- Remember important information across conversations
- Access dynamic content that changes frequently
- Store preferences, facts, and context about your business
- Maintain consistent knowledge that doesn't need document uploads

## Notes vs Knowledge Sources

| Feature | Notes | Knowledge Sources |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Content Type** | Text written directly in MindPal | Uploaded files (PDF, Word, etc.) or URLs |
| **Editing** | Easy inline editing | Requires re-upload or re-learn |
| **Best For** | Dynamic info, preferences, quick facts | Comprehensive documents, reference materials |
| **Format** | Rich text with formatting | Original file format |
| **Size** | Shorter, focused entries | Longer documents |

## How Notes Work

1. **You create notes** with specific information you want agents to remember
2. **You assign notes** to agents that need this information
3. **Agents automatically access** assigned notes during conversations
4. **Notes update instantly** - changes are reflected immediately in agent responses

## Creating and Managing Notes

### Creating a Note

1. Go to **"Assets"** → **"Notes"** in your workspace
2. Click **"+ Create note"** or the create button
3. Add a **Title** - make it descriptive so you can find it later
4. Write your **Content** using the rich text editor
5. Add **Categories** (optional) to organize your notes

### Rich Text Editor Features

The note editor supports:
- **Headings** - Structure your content with H1, H2, H3
- **Formatting** - Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- **Lists** - Bullet points and numbered lists
- **Links** - Add hyperlinks to external resources
- **Tables** - Organize structured information
- **Code blocks** - Format technical content

### Organizing Notes with Categories

Use categories (tags) to organize notes by topic:
- `product-info` - Product details and specifications
- `company-policies` - Internal guidelines and rules
- `customer-preferences` - Client-specific information
- `faq` - Frequently asked questions and answers

You can filter and search notes by category in the sidebar.

## Assigning Notes to Agents

2. Scroll to the **Notes** section
3. Click **"Add notes"**
4. Select the notes you want to assign
5. Save your agent

### Method 2: From the Notes Library

1. Open a note
2. Click the share/assign button

## Use Cases

### 1. Product Information

Store product details, pricing, and specifications that agents need to reference:

```

```

## Agent Memory Tools

When you assign notes to an agent, the agent gains special abilities to work with that information:

### Automatic Access
Agents automatically see and use assigned notes - no special prompting required.

### Memory Tools (Advanced)
Agents can also create, update, and delete notes during conversations:

- **Create notes** - Save new information from conversations
- **Update notes** - Modify existing information
- **Delete notes** - Remove outdated information

This enables agents to maintain a learning memory that grows over time.

  **Tip**: Use notes for information that changes frequently. For static reference documents like user manuals or policy documents, use Knowledge Sources instead.

## Sharing Notes

Notes can be made public for sharing:

1. Open the note you want to share
2. Click the **"Make Public"** toggle
3. Copy the shareable link

Public notes are accessible via a unique URL without requiring MindPal login.

## Best Practices

### Keep Notes Focused
Each note should cover one topic. Instead of one massive "Company Info" note, create separate notes for:
- Company Overview
- Product Details
- Pricing Information
- Contact Information

### Use Clear Titles
Make titles descriptive and searchable:
- "Refund Policy - 30 Day Guarantee"
- "Product: Enterprise Plan Features"
- "Client: ABC Company Preferences"

### Update Regularly
Notes are meant to be dynamic. Review and update them when:
- Prices change
- Policies update
- New products launch
- Client preferences change

### Organize with Categories
Use consistent category naming across your workspace:
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `product-info`, `client-data`
- Be specific: `pricing-2024` instead of just `pricing`
- Limit to 2-4 categories per note

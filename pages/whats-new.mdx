### Agent API Trigger

When working with your AI agents on MindPal, there may be chances where you would want your agents to send "reports" of their work (after answering/resolving a query) to somewhere. This could be your CRM, CMS, ticketing system, or any other apps that would help you complete your workflows.

We're glad to announce that this is now possible with MindPal! With our custom API trigger feature for agent, you can now configure your agent so that they will always "report" to you (by sending a request to a specific URL). This will surely open up a lot of exciting opportunities to further leverage MindPal for your work.

### Visual Assembly Builder

We heard you! Our AI Assembly builder sucked.

That's why we've completely revamped it, bringing you a more VISUAL + INTUITIVE + RELIABLE experience building multi-agent assembly lines on MindPal!

Key improvements this time:

- Visual flow (so you always have a bird-eye view of how the assembly is constructed)
- Ability to refer to trigger input and other steps' output in one step's prompt as variables (much more seamless and intuitive compared to selections), helping you passing data along the process
- Significantly improved quality of AI-generated assemblies

# How to Generate a 6-Hat Thinking Analysis for any Decision You have to make

By utilizing the 6-hat thinking method, you can consider decisions from six different perspectives - logical, emotional, creative, optimistic, pessimistic, and process-driven. This comprehensive analysis ensures a well-rounded view of the situation, leading to better outcomes. Imagine the confidence you'll have when making critical decisions knowing that you've thoroughly examined all angles. Whether you're a business leader, a project manager, or an entrepreneur, mastering the art of 6-hat thinking can elevate your decision-making skills to new heights.

MindPal's multi-agent assembly feature streamlines this analysis process. By building a multi-agent assembly specialized in anlyzing any decision according to the 6 Hats of Thinking framework, MindPal would be a life-saver for you, saving you time and reducing decision fatigue. This is just like having a trustworthy thinking copilot by your side.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build such an assembly with MindPal.

### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "6-Hat Thinking Analysis".

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. In this case, you may want to provide a brief description of the Decision you are currently presented with. These inputs will help generate meaningful output. Once you've determined the inputs, add them to your assembly.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Now it's time to add the necessary steps to your assembly.

Since we are leveraging the 6 Hats of Thinking framework, we suggest making 6 steps corresponding to the 6 hats, as follows:

1. White Hat Thinking (Facts)

2. Red Hat Thinking (Emotions)

3. Black Hat Thinking (Cautiousness)

4. Yellow Hat Thinking (Benefits)

5. Green Hat Thinking (Creativity)

6. Blue Hat Thinking (Control)

Each step should have the appropriate agent assigned to it and the necessary inputs specified. You should build and configure each agent properly so that they can be well-equipped to excel at what they're supposed to do.

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly. You can now start a new run of the assembly and provide a sample decision information to generate a full-scale 6-Hat Thinking Analysis in minutes.

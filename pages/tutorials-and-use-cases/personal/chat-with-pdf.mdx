# How to Chat with Your PDF with MindPal
In the age of information overload, staying organized and efficient is more important than ever. MindPal is revolutionizing the way we interact with our documents, especially PDFs. Gone are the days of tedious manual searching through pages. With MindPal, you can now chat with your PDFs as if they were a knowledgeable colleague ready to assist you. Let's dive into how MindPal makes this possible.

### Step 1: Upload Your PDF to MindPal
To start chatting with your PDF, you first need to upload it to MindPal. This is a straightforward process:

- Navigate to Knowledge Sources tab from the side bar
- Click on the "New knowledge source" button in the top right
- Select Upload a file option, and choose the PDF from your computer
- Wait for the upload to complete, and your PDF will be ready for interaction.
- You can add more PDF if you want to chat with all of them together


### Step 2 (Optional): Activate AI Agents
MindPal's AI agents are the key to unlocking the knowledge within your PDF. Here's how to activate them:

- Once your PDF is uploaded, go to the Agents tab from the side bar.
- Create a new agent, and assign the agent to your PDF. This will enable the AI to understand and interact with the content.


### Step 3: Start Chatting
With your uploaded PDF and Agent, it's time to start the conversation:

- Click on the "New chat" from the side bar.
- Type in your query or topic of interest. For example, "What are the key points in chapter 3?"
- Select the uploaded PDF as the knowledge source and the agent (if you have), you can choose just one PDF or many of them.
- The AI agent will analyze the content and provide you with an answer, just as if you were chatting with a real person.

# How to Automate Meeting Recaps with MindPal

Meetings are an essential part of any organization's workflow. They provide a platform for collaboration, decision-making, and progress tracking. However, keeping track of all the discussions and action items from meetings can be a daunting task. This is where automating meeting recaps can be a game-changer.

## Why Automate Meeting Recaps?

A meeting recap is a summary of discussions, decisions, and action items from a meeting. Automating this process can save time, improve accuracy, and ensure that key points are not missed. It also allows team members to focus on implementing action items rather than spending time on manual recap creation.

## Best Practices for Writing Meeting Recaps

When writing meeting recaps, it's important to be concise, include key takeaways, action items, and deadlines. The recap should capture the essence of the meeting without being overly detailed. Consistency in format and structure is also crucial for easy readability and reference.

## Building an Assembly on MindPal to Automate Meeting Recaps

### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "Meeting Recap Workflow."

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. In thei case, you may want to provide the meeting recording as inputs. These inputs will help generate meaningful output. Once you've determined the inputs, add them to your assembly.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Now it's time to add the necessary steps to your assembly. It's up to you to decide what steps are necessary for a quality and effective brand strategy.

Here is our suggested set of steps:

1. Meeting Summary

2. Agenda

3. Action Items

4. Key Questions

Each step should have the appropriate agent assigned to it and the necessary inputs specified. You should build and configure each agent properly so that they can be well-equipped to excel at what they're supposed to do.

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly. You can now start a new run of the assembly and provide a meeting recording to generate its meeting recap in minutes.

### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "YouTube Video Repurposer".

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. In this case, you may want to provide the original YouTube video as an input. You may add additional inputs if needed. These inputs will help generate meaningful lesson content. Once you've determined the inputs, add them to your assembly.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Now it's time to add the necessary steps to your assembly. It's up to you to decide what steps are necessary for a quality and effective repurposing output.

Here is our suggested set of steps:

1. Write a Facebook post

2. Write a LinkedIn post

3. Write a Twitter (X) post

4. Write an Instagram post

5. Write a marketing email

6. Write a blog post

Each step should have the appropriate agent assigned to it and the necessary inputs specified. You should build and configure each agent properly so that they can be well-equipped to excel at what they're supposed to do.

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly. You can now start a new run of the assembly and provide a sample YouTube video to generate repurposed content.

</Steps>

By utilizing this assembly, you can save time and effort in repurposing any YouTube video. The generated output can serve as an initial draft that you can further refine and customize to meet your specific needs.

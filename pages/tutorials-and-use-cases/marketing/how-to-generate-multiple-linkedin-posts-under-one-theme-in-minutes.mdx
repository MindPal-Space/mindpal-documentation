### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "LinkedIn Post Writer".

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. In this case, let's provide the Topic Brief as an input. These inputs will help generate meaningful ontent. Once you've determined the inputs, add them to your assembly.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Now it's time to add the necessary steps to your assembly. It's up to you to decide what steps are necessary for this workflow.

Since this workflow is designed for writing LinkedIn posts in different styles, each step should focus on writing a post following a specific framework.

Here is our suggested set of steps:

1. AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) Post
2. BISCUIT (Brief, Interest, Story, Conclusion, Unique, Invitation, Target) Post
3. PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve) Post
4. ACCA (Awareness, Comprehension, Conviction, Action) Post
5. QUEST (Question, Unique Insight, Engage, Story, Takeaway) Post
6. Utilize Star Chain Hook Post
7. SLAP (Startling Fact, Link to Audience, Application, Punchline) Post
8. BAB (Before, After, Bridge) Post

Each step should have the appropriate agent assigned to it and the necessary inputs specified. You should build and configure each agent properly so that they can be well-equipped to excel at what they're supposed to do.

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly. You can now start a new run of the assembly and provide a topic brief to generate different LinkedIn posts in minutes.

Picture this: saving time, reducing stress, and still producing top-notch LinkedIn content that resonates with your audience. With MindPal AI Assembly, you can unlock a world of possibilities and elevate your online presence like never before.

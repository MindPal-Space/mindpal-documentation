# How to Evaluate your Business Idea with the Alex Hormozi Test

Building a successful business requires more than just a great idea. It involves understanding your target audience deeply. The Alex Hormozi Test for Business provides a structured approach to assess the viability of your business idea:

1. Pain: Does your audience direly need your offering?
2. Purchasing Power: Can your audience afford your product/service?
3. Easy to Target: Is it feasible to reach and engage your ideal customers?
4. Growing Market: Are you tapping into a thriving industry?

In this tutorial video, we will show you how an AI assembly on MindPal can help you evaluate your next business idea, using the framework above, in minutes.

### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "The Alex Hormozi Test for Business".

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. In this case, you may want to provide the Business Idea and Target Audience as inputs. These inputs will help generate meaningful analysis. Once you've determined the inputs, add them to your assembly.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Now it's time to add the necessary steps to your assembly. It's up to you to decide what steps are necessary for a quality and effective analysis.

Our suggested set of steps are 4 steps corresponding to the elements of the Alex Hormozi Test for Business.

Each step should have the appropriate agent assigned to it and the necessary inputs specified. You should build and configure each agent properly so that they can be well-equipped to excel at what they're supposed to do.

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly. You can now start a new run of the assembly and provide a sample business idea and target audience to generate the analysis in minutes.

By utilizing this assembly, you can save time and effort. Of course, you still have to do your own evaluation and make your own decision, but having this AI workflow is just like having a personal business consultant by your side.

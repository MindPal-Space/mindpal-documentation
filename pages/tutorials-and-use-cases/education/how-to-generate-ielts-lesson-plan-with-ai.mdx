### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "IELTS Lesson Planner".

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. For example, you may want to provide a topic and the level of your students as inputs. These inputs will help generate meaningful lesson content. Once you've determined the inputs, add them to your assembly.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Now it's time to add the necessary steps to your assembly. It's up to you to decide what steps are necessary for a quality and meaningful lesson plan.

Here is our suggested set of steps:

1. Generate useful vocabulary

2. Generate useful collocations

3. Generate useful grammar

4. Generate related IELTS speaking questions with samples

5. Generate related IELTS writing questions with samples

Each step should have the appropriate agent assigned to it and the necessary inputs specified. You should build and configure each agent properly so that they can be well-equipped to excel at what they're supposed to do.

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly. You can now start a new run of the assembly and provide different topics and student levels to generate customized lesson plans.

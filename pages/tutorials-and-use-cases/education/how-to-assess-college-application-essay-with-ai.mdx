# How to Assess College Application Personal Statement Essays with AI

If you are a mentor or teacher guiding students through the college application essay process, or if you are a student yourself, then you are likely familiar with the struggle and stress of managing multiple essays simultaneously. Giving feedback can be challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. However, what if there was a way to automate this process?

Imagine being able to create a workflow where you input an essay into MindPal, and it automatically assesses your essay based on your desired criteria, providing personalized feedback. This would not only save time for both teachers and students, but also allow for additional personalized feedback from real humans later on. Considering the number of students or essays to handle, this would be a significant time-saver.

In this tutorial, let's try creating this multi-agent assembly!

### Step 1: Create a New Multi-Agent Assembly

To get started, log in to your MindPal account and navigate to the multi-agent assembly page. Click on the "Create New Assembly" button and give your assembly a name, such as "College Application Personal Statement Essay Assessment".

### Step 2: Define Inputs

Next, think about what inputs your assembly will require. In this case, we will need the essay to be assessed. You may want to add other inputs as well, such as some background information on this student to provide more specific context to facilitate better assessment.

### Step 3: Add Steps to Your Assembly

Set up the steps to be executed, each step should analyze one aspect of the essay based on specific criteria.

The specific criteria can vary depending on your expertise. If you're an expert in this area, feel free to create different agents for a rubric or assessment framework that you believe in.

For demonstration purposes, we will now borrow a framework from the College Essay Guy. This framework suggests that we can assess personal statement essays based on four qualities: values, vulnerability, insight, and craft.

We will create a MindPal agent excellent at analyzing each quality. Once done, we can assign these agents to sequentially analyze the given essay.

Once you have assigned the agents to each quality and provided the essay as input, your assembly is ready to go!

### Step 4: Create & Test Your Assembly

Once you've added all the steps to your assembly, click on the "Create" button to create your assembly.

You can test this assembly by creating a new Assembly Run and providing a sample essay for it to assess.

</Steps>

Remember, the assembly we've described may not be the best for your specific case, as we are not experts in this area. However, with your expertise, you can build a high-quality AI assembly capable of assessing personal statement essays.

By using this assembly, you can save a significant amount of time for both teachers and students. Students can also receive personalized feedback from real humans based on the initial analysis provided by the workflow.

We encourage you to try creating your own assembly on MindPal for your specific use case. We hope you find this tutorial helpful!

# Which MindPal plan is for you?

In MindPal, there are two main building blocks: MindPal Core and MindPal Chatbot.

MindPal Core is a set of features that allow users to interact and utilize the agents within the MindPal app. It provides unlimited AI queries per month, knowledge storage, and other functionalities.

On the other hand, MindPal Chatbot is a feature that enables users to publish their agents as chatbots. It offers different pricing plans based on the number of chatbot messages per month, custom branding, and enhanced security options.

To determine which MindPal plan is suitable for you, consider your specific needs and requirements. If you are an individual user looking for personal use, the Personal Pro plan may be the best fit. It offers unlimited AI queries per month and 5 GB of knowledge storage.

For teams, the Team Pro plan is recommended. It provides unlimited AI queries per month, 10 GB of knowledge storage per seat, and additional features for sharing and collaborating on agents, knowledge sources, chatbots, chat threads, and smart notes across the team.

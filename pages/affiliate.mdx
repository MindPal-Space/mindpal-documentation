# Affiliate & Partner Programs

MindPal offers two collaborative ways to earn rewards by sharing our AI workspace solution with your network. Everyone can start with our affiliate program - and if you have an established audience, you can also access additional benefits through our partner program!

## Affiliate Program

Our affiliate program is open to everyone through an automated process, allowing anyone to earn credit for referrals to MindPal. Join and earn recurring commissions by recommending our AI workspace solution to your network. We offer a generous 20% recurring commission on all purchases made by users who sign up through your affiliate link.

### How It Works

1. **Sign Up Process**

   - Apply through our [affiliate portal](https://mindpalspace.lemonsqueezy.com/affiliates)
   - Your application goes through two approval rounds:
     - Lemon Squeezy verification (primary platform)
     - MindPal verification (usually instant)

2. **Tracking & Attribution**

   - All signups through your affiliate link are permanently associated with your affiliate code
   - You earn commission on ALL future purchases made by these users
   - Commission applies to both initial and recurring payments

3. **Commission Structure**
   - 20% recurring commission on all purchases
   - Up to $898.00 commission per sale
   - No limit on earning potential
   - Minimum payout: $10.00
   - NET30 payout terms (e.g., January commissions paid on March 15th)

### Monitoring Performance

Track checkout clicks and revenue through your Lemon Squeezy dashboard.

## FAQs

### Why does my affiliate dashboard show zero clicks?

Don't worry - this is actually normal! The dashboard only shows clicks on checkout pages, not landing page visits. Here's how our attribution works:

- Your affiliate link directs users to the MindPal landing page first
- We store your affiliate code for everyone who signs up through your link
- You'll get credit for all their future purchases, even if they don't buy immediately
- Want to know how many signups you've referred? Just email support@mindpal.io with your affiliate code!

### What does recurring commission mean?

It means you will receive a 20% commission for the lifetime of the referral's account as long as they stay subscribed.

### My application seems stuck. What should I do?

If your application is taking longer than expected, it's likely in the Lemon Squeezy screening phase. Here's what to know:

- The MindPal verification round is usually instant
- If you're waiting more than a few days, you're probably in the Lemon Squeezy round
- Solution: Email hello@lemonsqueezy.com to request an expedited review (feel free to cc us support@mindpal.io)
- Be sure to mention you're applying for the MindPal affiliate program

### Which program is right for me?

There's no need to choose - these programs complement each other! Everyone can start with the Affiliate Program, which is open to all and provides an excellent way to earn commissions with minimal commitment.

As you build success as an affiliate, you can explore the Partner Program if you have an established audience. Many of our most successful partners started as affiliates and naturally progressed to a deeper relationship as they saw positive results.

### Can I reuse MindPal's marketing materials?

Yes, you have full freedom to reuse our existing marketing content from our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MindPalSpace) and [blog posts](http://mindpal.space/blog) to promote MindPal on your own channels.

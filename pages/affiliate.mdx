## FAQs

### Why does my dashboard show zero clicks?

Don't worry - this is actually normal! The dashboard only shows clicks on checkout pages, not landing page visits. Here's how our attribution works:

- Your affiliate link directs users to the MindPal landing page first
- We store your affiliate code for everyone who signs up through your link
- You'll get credit for all their future purchases, even if they don't buy immediately
- Want to know how many signups you've referred? Just email support@mindpal.io with your affiliate code!

### My application seems stuck. What should I do?

If your application is taking longer than expected, it's likely in the Lemon Squeezy screening phase. Here's what to know:

- The MindPal verification round is usually instant
- If you're waiting more than a few days, you're probably in the Lemon Squeezy round
- Solution: Email hello@lemonsqueezy.com to request an expedited review (feel free to cc us support@mindpal.io)
- Be sure to mention you're applying for the MindPal affiliate program

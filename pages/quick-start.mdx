# Welcome to MindPal: A Quick Start Guide

Thank you for choosing MindPal, the platform designed to help you build AI agents and multi-agent workflows to automate your tasks. In this quick start guide, we will walk you through the essential steps to get you started with MindPal and make the most out of its features.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Team of AI Agents

The first thing you need to do is set up your team of AI agents. Think of these AI agents as your own team of AI employees or assistants. They can be provided with specific requirements and instructions, connected to knowledge sources and external tools, and configured to be most suitable for the task at hand.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: 24,
    position: "relative",
    width: "100%",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzK3Edt3YLg?si=V_6U62nCFBB50mtZ"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Step 2: Provide Knowledge to Your Agents

Your agents can be trained on custom data such as documents, videos, audios, websites, or connected to external knowledge sources like Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube. You can also use the Smart Note feature on MindPal to write notes that can be constantly updated, allowing your agents to dynamically learn and have the most up-to-date data.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: 24,
    position: "relative",
    width: "100%",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMn60Hf9gXw?si=PNmRHLLh5rPpoHMc"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Step 3: Bring Your Agents to Work

On MindPal, you have various ways to work with your agents:

### 1. Conventional Chat Interface

Summon an agent and chat with it.

### 2. Co-writing in Smart Note

Summon an agent to co-write with you, where it can help generate the initial draft or edit the output alongside you.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: 24,
    position: "relative",
    width: "100%",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6dzVFHwVDrI?si=GUNDO-rjM71Y2Ece"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### 3. Publish as Chatbots

Transform your agents into chatbots that can communicate with external stakeholders on your behalf.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: 24,
    position: "relative",
    width: "100%",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ForXH2bjVfw?si=3l5alDfrjbNZM2Il"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### 4. Multi-Agent Assembly

Connect multiple agents to collaborate with each other and solve complex tasks.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: 24,
    position: "relative",
    width: "100%",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-igxywhsMQ?si=rr4Q0o-gkFGgj0Fg"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

# Introducing MindPal's AI Agent and Workflow Setup Service

Since we started MindPal, we've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of customers, from individual entrepreneurs to large enterprises, to help automate tasks & processes in their business with AI. Our platform, [MindPal](https://mindpal.io/), has proven to be a powerful tool for building AI agents and workflows that can automate virtually any task. Whether it's generating SEO-optimized articles, providing well-researched analysis reports, or screening CVs, our AI solutions have delivered outstanding results across various use cases. Check out [our abundant template library](https://mindpal.space/workflow) to get a better sense of what's possible with MindPal.

However, we recognize that setting up and training these AI agents and workflows can be time-consuming and may require a learning curve. While we've made efforts to simplify the process, we understand that some use cases are more complex and may require dedicated support. That's why, based on customer feedback, we're launching this paid service to provide personalized assistance in setting up a tailored set of AI agents and workflows for your business.

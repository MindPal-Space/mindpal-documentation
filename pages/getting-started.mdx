# Getting Started

Welcome to MindPal! This guide will walk you through creating your first AI agent and workflow step-by-step.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";
import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. A MindPal account (sign up at [app.mindpal.space](https://app.mindpal.space))
2. A workspace created (this happens automatically when you sign up)

## Create Your First AI Agent

<Steps>

### Navigate to the Agent Library

1. Log in to your MindPal workspace
2. Click on **"Agent"** in the left sidebar
3. You'll see your agent library (empty if you're just starting)

### Create a New Agent

Click the **"+ New Agent"** button. You have three options:

- **Let AI do the work**: Describe what you need, and MindPal will configure the agent for you
- **Use a template**: Browse pre-made agents and customize them
- **Start from scratch**: Build your agent manually with full control

For this tutorial, choose **"Start from scratch"**.

### Configure the Agent Basics

Give your agent a clear identity:

1. **Title**: Name your agent (e.g., "Blog Post Writer")
2. **Background**: Describe who the agent is and what it does

Example background:
```
You are an experienced content writer specializing in engaging blog posts.
You write in a conversational yet professional tone, focusing on providing
value to readers while maintaining SEO best practices.
```

### Set the Desired Output

Define how you want the agent to format its responses:

```
Structure your blog posts with:
- An attention-grabbing headline
- A compelling introduction (2-3 sentences)
- 3-5 main sections with subheadings
- A conclusion with a call to action
- Keep total length between 800-1200 words
```

### Choose a Language Model

Select the AI model that powers your agent:

- **GPT-4o Mini** (1 credit) - Fast and cost-effective for simple tasks
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (1 credit) - Great balance of speed and quality
- **GPT-5** (15 credits) - High-quality responses
- **Claude 4 Sonnet** (20 credits) - Excellent for nuanced writing

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Start with a cheaper model and upgrade only if you need better quality. You can always change the model later.
</Callout>

### Test Your Agent

1. Click **"Save"** to save your agent configuration
2. Click **"Run"** or the chat icon to open the chat interface
3. Send a message like: "Write a blog post about the benefits of morning routines"
4. Review the response and iterate on your agent's configuration if needed

### (Optional) Publish as a Chatbot

To share your agent with others:

1. Go to the **"Chatbot"** section in the left sidebar
2. Click **"+ New Chatbot"**
3. Select your agent as the "brain"
4. Configure the chatbot appearance and settings
5. Click **"Publish"** to get a shareable link

</Steps>

## Create Your First Workflow

Workflows connect multiple agents to handle complex, multi-step processes.

<Steps>

### Navigate to the Workflow Library

1. Click on **"Workflow"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"+ New Workflow"**

### Choose Your Starting Point

Like agents, you have three options:
- **Let AI do the work**: Describe your process and let MindPal build it
- **Use a template**: Start from a pre-made workflow
- **Start from scratch**: Build manually using the visual builder

For this tutorial, choose **"Start from scratch"**.

### Add a Human Input Node

Every workflow starts with collecting user input:

1. In the workflow builder, you'll see a **Human Input** node already placed
2. Click on it to configure input fields
3. Add fields like:
   - **Topic** (Text) - "What topic should we write about?"
   - **Target Audience** (Text) - "Who is the target audience?"
   - **Tone** (Select) - Options: Professional, Casual, Friendly

### Add an Agent Node

1. Click the **"+"** button below the Human Input node
2. Select **"Agent Node"**
3. Configure it:
   - **Agent**: Select your Blog Post Writer agent (or leave blank for a general agent)
   - **Prompt**: Write the task, referencing inputs:
   ```
   Write a blog post about {{Topic}} for {{Target Audience}}.
   Use a {{Tone}} tone.
   ```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Variables appear in purple when properly configured. Click the "+" button in the prompt field to insert variables from previous steps.
</Callout>

### Add More Steps (Optional)

Extend your workflow with additional nodes:

- **Another Agent Node**: Add an editor agent to review the content
- **Loop Node**: Process multiple topics at once
- **Router Node**: Branch based on conditions
- **Webhook Node**: Send results to external systems

### Test Your Workflow

1. Click **"Save"** to save your workflow
2. Click **"Run"** to open the workflow runner
3. Fill in the input fields
4. Click **"Run Workflow"** and watch it execute

### (Optional) Publish as a Form

To share your workflow with others:

1. Go to the **"Form"** tab in your workflow
2. Configure the form appearance and settings
3. Set access controls and rate limits
4. Click **"Publish"** to get a shareable link or embed code

</Steps>

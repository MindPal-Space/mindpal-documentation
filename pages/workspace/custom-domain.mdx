# Custom Domain

MindPal allows you to fully white-label your [published agents (chatbots)](/agent/chatbot) and [published workflows (forms)](/workflow/run/form) by hosting them on your own domain. This feature is available as an [add-on](/workspace/plan-billing/addons#custom-domain-for-shared-agentsworkflows) to your workspace.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";
import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

## Overview

When you publish an agent (chatbot) or a multi-agent workflow (form) on MindPal, the system generates default links such as:

- `chatbot.getmindpal.com/[YOUR_CHATBOT_SLUG]` for chatbots
- `workflow.getmindpal.com/[YOUR_WORKFLOW_SLUG]` for workflow forms

With Custom Domain, you can replace these default domains with your own branded domains, such as:

- `yourcompany.com`
- `chatbot.yourcompany.com`
- `workflow.yourcompany.com`
- `ai.yourcompany.com/tool-a`

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

Once you've added the Custom Domain add-on to your workspace, you can start connecting your own domains to your MindPal workspace. Here's how:

<Steps>
### Go to workspace settings
Go to your workspace settings by clicking on the "Manage" button on the left sidebar or using the link [http://app.mindpal.space/[YOUR_WORKSPACE_SLUG]/settings](http://app.mindpal.space/personal/settings?tab=usage)

### Navigate to the Usage tab

Click on the **Usage** tab to access domain management options

### Add your custom domain

Select **Add Custom Domain**

### Configure domain details

Enter your domain name and specify whether it applies to chatbots or workflows.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  You can connect root domains (e.g., yourcompany.com) or subdomains (e.g.,
  ai.yourcompany.com). Note that each custom domain configuration can only be
  applied to either chatbots OR workflows, not both, as they use different
  engines and interfaces. A common practice is to set up separate custom domain
  entries (e.g., `chatbot.yourcompany.com` for chatbots and
  `workflow.yourcompany.com` for workflows).

### Add DNS records

Follow the instructions for the required DNS records provided by MindPal

### Wait for verification

Wait until your Custom Domain is shown as "Valid configuration". This typically takes just a few minutes to take effect, but in some cases it may take longer.

</Steps>

## Applying Custom Domains to your Chatbots or Workflows

Once your custom domain is validly configured, you can apply it to your chatbots or workflows:

<Steps>
### Open chatbot/workflow settings
Go to your chatbot or workflow settings

### Navigate to "Access & Security" section

Click on **Access and Security**

### Enable custom domain

Turn on **Enable Custom Domain**

### Choose your domain

Choose the Custom Domain you wish to use

### Configure path (optional)

Optionally define a path (e.g., `chatbot.yourcompany.com/chatbot1`)

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Using specific paths is recommended when hosting multiple chatbots or workflows on the same custom domain.
</Callout>
</Steps>

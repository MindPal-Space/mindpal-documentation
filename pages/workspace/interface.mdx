# Interface Customization

The interface customization settings allow you to personalize your workspace's appearance and branding. You can access these settings by going to **Workspace Settings** â†’ **General** tab.

## Workspace Name

You can set a custom name for your workspace. This name will appear in the navigation and workspace-related elements. Note that your workspace will still be accessible through MindPal's domain (app.mindpal.space/your-workspace-name).

## Workspace Icon

You can customize your workspace's icon by providing a URL to your desired image. This icon will be displayed in various places throughout the interface, including the navigation bar and favicon.

## Theme Color

Choose a theme color that matches your brand identity. The selected color will be applied to various UI elements across your workspace to maintain consistent branding.

## MindPal Branding

You have the option to remove MindPal branding from your workspace interface. This setting affects how the MindPal logo and name appear within your workspace.

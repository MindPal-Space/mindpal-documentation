<Steps>

### Open your workspace settings

There are two ways to get there:

- **Quick way**: Click the "Upgrade" button in the left sidebar
- **Direct way**: Go to app.mindpal.space/[your_workspace_slug]/settings

  First time here? You'll need to create an account - just click "Sign up /
  Create an account" on the authentication page.
</Callout>

### Add your license key

Your license key is like your digital receipt. You can find it in:

- The confirmation email we sent when you purchased, or
- Your [Lemon Squeezy orders dashboard](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders)

Then:

1. Find the input field on the Workspace Settings page that says "Activate your plan with a valid license key"
2. Copy and paste your key into it
3. Hit "Activate"

### Start using premium features

That's it! Your workspace will instantly upgrade with all premium features. No restart or refresh needed.

</Steps>

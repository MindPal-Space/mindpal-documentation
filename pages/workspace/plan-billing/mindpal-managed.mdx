## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this plan for me?

MindPal Managed is for business founders and owners who want to become AI-native without the R&D headache. We handle the strategy, implementation, and optimization while you focus on running your business.

You're a good fit if you're facing these common challenges:

- **Lack of Clarity:** The AI landscape is overwhelming with constant new models and features. You want results, not research.

- **Past Failures:** You've tried AI before but got poor results due to bad prompts, insufficient context, or outdated models, and you're not sure how to make it work.

- **No Time:** Building reliable AI systems requires constant testing and tweaking. You need a business partner, not another project on your plate.

### Why a flat rate pricing instead of project-based?

We intentionally choose a flat rate pricing for MindPal Managed because of 3 main reasons:

- **Endless Opportunities:** Once you start using AI agents, you'll constantly discover new automation possibilities. We want to be your ongoing partner as these opportunities emerge.

- **Sustainable Adoption:** Rolling out AI across your team takes time. Our monthly model lets you implement solutions at a healthy pace without overwhelming your team.

- **Rapid Innovation:** The AI world changes weekly with new models and features. Our ongoing partnership ensures you're always using the latest tools for your business.

### What does "unlimited requests" actually mean?

Yes, you can submit as many AI automation requests as you need. We process them one at a time, with a typical turnaround of 1-3 business days per request depending on complexity levels. Large projects can be broken down and handled as a series of smaller requests.

### Can you help with integrations like Zapier, Make.com, or MCP?

Yes, we can help you with anything falling into the scope of AI & automation, including integrating your AI agents with popular tools like Zapier, Make.com, and Model Context Protocol (MCP). However, we can't work with internal systems we don't have access to or build custom features outside our core automation services.

### Who owns the automations we build together?

You retain full ownership of all automations we build for you. If you decide to switch to a self-service plan or end your subscription, you'll keep complete access to your AI agents and workflows. You can continue to use, modify, and run them independently.

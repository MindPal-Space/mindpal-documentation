## What's a Webhook?

Think of a webhook as a digital messenger. It carries information from one app to another automatically. In this case, it will carry data from your MindPal workflow to other apps of your choice.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Automation Platform

First, you need to choose an automation platform. Popular options include Zapier, Make, or Activepiece. These platforms help connect different apps together. Here's what to do:

1.  Sign up for an account on your chosen platform (let's use Zapier as an example).
    
2.  Click on "Create Zap" (that's what Zapier calls its automations).
    
3.  For the trigger, search for and select "Webhooks by Zapier".
    
4.  Choose "Catch Hook" as the trigger event.
    
5.  Zapier will now give you a unique webhook URL. This is important, so keep this page open.
    

### Step 2: Connect MindPal to Your Automation

Now that you have your webhook URL, it's time to tell MindPal where to send its data:

1.  Go to your MindPal workspace.
    
2.  Open the workflow you want to connect.
    
3.  Scroll all the way down in the workflow builder.
    
4.  Look for a section called "Post Run Webhook".
    
5.  Paste the webhook URL you got from Zapier into this section.
    
6.  Save your changes.
    

That's it! You've now connected MindPal to your automation platform.

### Step 3: Understanding What MindPal Sends

Every time your MindPal workflow runs, it will send data to your webhook. This data includes:

*   A unique ID for each workflow run
    
*   The ID and title of your workflow
    
*   The input you gave to the workflow
    
*   The output (result) of the workflow
    

This information arrives in a specific format (called JSON). Don't worry if you're not familiar with JSON - your automation platform will help you use this data easily.

## What Can You Do With This?

The possibilities are endless! Here are a few ideas:

1.  Automatically create a new task in Trello or Asana based on your workflow output.
    
2.  Send the results of your workflow to a Slack channel.
    
3.  Add the generated content to a Google Sheet for easy tracking.
    
4.  Create a draft email with the workflow results.
    

## How to Get Started

1.  Think about what you want to happen after your MindPal workflow runs.
    
2.  Choose the app you want to connect (like Trello, Slack, or Google Sheets).
    
3.  In your automation platform, add an action step using your chosen app.
    
4.  Tell the automation platform which parts of the MindPal data to use.
    
5.  Test your automation to make sure it works.
    

## Tips for Success

*   Start simple. Try connecting MindPal to just one app at first.
    
*   Test your automation thoroughly before relying on it for important tasks.
    
*   Don't be afraid to experiment with different combinations of apps and actions.

# Best Practices for Designing Workflows on MindPal



Creating effective workflows on MindPal requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some best practices to help you design efficient and robust workflows.

## 1. Ensure Proper Variable Mentioning



Make sure to mention the right and sufficient variables in the prompt of each step in the workflow. If any variables are missing, the agents in the workflow nodes will not have access to the necessary context to perform their tasks effectively. Always double-check that all required variables are included.

## 2. Choose the Right Node for Iteration



- **Use Loop Node**: When you have a list of items that need to be processed by one agent iteratively, the Loop Node is the best choice. This allows the agent to work through each item in the list efficiently.
- **Use Orchestrator-Worker Node**: When you have an undefined list of tasks and are unsure which agent will work best, but you know the general principles, the Orchestrator-Worker Node is more appropriate. This setup allows for dynamic task assignment based on the orchestrator's planning.

## 3. Avoid Consecutive Human Input Nodes



You should not have two consecutive Human Input Nodes in your workflow. This can lead to confusion and disrupt the flow of the process. Instead, ensure that each Human Input Node is followed by a processing step or another type of node.

## 4. Set Clear Criteria in the Evaluator Agent



Always strive to establish clear criteria in the Evaluator Agent within the Evaluator Optimizer Node. If the criteria are not well-defined, your workflow may become trapped in an infinite loop, as the agent will not know when to stop iterating.

## 5. Use Gate Node Appropriately



Utilize the Gate Node effectively, especially if your workflow includes many steps or involves the use of expensive models. The Gate Node can help control the flow of the workflow and prevent unnecessary consumption of resources.

By following these best practices, you can design workflows on MindPal that are efficient, effective, and easy to manage. Happy workflow designing!

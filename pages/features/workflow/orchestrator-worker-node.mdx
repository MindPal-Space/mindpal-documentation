# Orchestrator-Worker Node on MindPal



The Orchestrator-Worker Node is a powerful feature in MindPal that enables you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. This node is well-suited for tasks where the subtasks needed cannot be predicted in advance, such as coding or research tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources.

## How the Orchestrator-Worker Node Works



In the Orchestrator-Worker Node, a central agent (the orchestrator) dynamically breaks down tasks into smaller subtasks and delegates them to worker agents. This allows for efficient and flexible task management, as the orchestrator can adjust the subtasks and worker agents as needed.

## Configuring the Orchestrator-Worker Node



To set up an Orchestrator-Worker Node, you will need to configure three essential components:

- **The Orchestrator Agent**: Choose the agent that will plan the tasks and create a to-do list.
- **The Instruction for the Orchestrator**: Provide the instruction for the orchestrator to plan the tasks and create a to-do list. This instruction should include the logic for breaking down the task into subtasks.
- **The List of Worker Agents**: Specify the list of worker agents that the orchestrator can assign tasks to. These worker agents will complete the subtasks assigned to them by the orchestrator.

## Benefits of the Orchestrator-Worker Node



The Orchestrator-Worker Node offers several benefits, including:

- **Flexibility**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks that can be adjusted as needed.
- **Efficiency**: Assign subtasks to worker agents, allowing for parallel processing and improved productivity.
- **Scalability**: Easily add or remove worker agents as needed to handle changes in task complexity or volume.

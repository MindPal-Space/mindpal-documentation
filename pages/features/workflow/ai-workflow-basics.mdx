# AI Workflow Basics

When it comes to complex business processes with multiple steps, relying on a single AI agent often isn't sufficient for achieving quality results. This is where MindPal's multi-agent workflows come into play. 

These workflows connect several agents in a step-by-step process, enabling them to share data and build upon each other's responses, ultimately enhancing the quality and efficiency of your outcomes.

## Getting Started with AI Multi-Agent Workflows

Creating an AI multi-agent workflow in MindPal is straightforward. You can start with a template from our extensive gallery, import a JSON file shared by others, or build from scratch. Alternatively, let MindPal generate an entire workflow for youâ€”just describe what you need, and MindPal will handle the initial setup, which you can then customize.

### Understanding Workflow Steps

An AI multi-agent workflow consists of two key types of steps:

1. **User Input Steps**: These steps pause the workflow to request input from users. You can add various input fields (text, URL, file, or image) and decide if they are required or optional. This flexibility allows for seamless human involvement while the AI performs its tasks.

2. **Agent Steps**: These are executed by AI agents in your workspace. You define the task for each agent, referencing user input or outputs from previous steps to ensure relevant and meaningful results.

### Running Your Workflow

Once your multi-agent workflow is set up, you can run it in four different modes:

1. **Single Run Mode**: Execute the workflow immediately with real-time output. Ideal for testing and one-off tasks.
   
2. **Run in Background Mode**: Process the workflow while you focus on other tasks. You can check back later for results.

3. **Supervised Mode**: Pause after each step for your approval, allowing you to review and refine outputs before proceeding.

4. **Bulk Run Mode**: Process multiple instances of the workflow simultaneously. Upload a set of inputs, and the system will handle them automatically.

### Sharing and Integrating Your Workflow

You can share your AI workflow with others by publishing it as a form, providing a sharable link and embed code for your website. Customize form settings to fit your needs. Alternatively, export the workflow setup as a JSON file for others to recreate in their accounts.

For integration with existing business automation, check out our API and webhooks reference for detailed instructions on triggering workflows programmatically.

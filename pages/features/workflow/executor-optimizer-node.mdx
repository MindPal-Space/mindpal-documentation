# Evaluator Optimizer Node on MindPal Multi-Agent Workflow



The Evaluator Optimizer Node is a specialized component in MindPal Multi-Agent Workflow designed to enhance the quality of results through iterative refinement. In this node, one agent generates the desired result while another agent provides evaluation and feedback in a continuous loop.

## When to Use the Evaluator Optimizer Node



This workflow is particularly effective when you have clear evaluation criteria and when iterative refinement can provide measurable value. Two signs that this node is a good fit are:

1. The agent's results can be demonstrably improved when receiving feedback
2. The agent can provide feedback on its own results.

This process is similar to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document.

## Configuring the Evaluator Optimizer Node



To set up the Evaluator Optimizer Node, you will need to configure four essential components:

- **Executor Agent**: This is the agent responsible for generating the desired result.
- **Instruction for Executor Agent**: Provide the instruction for the executor agent to generate the result.
- **Evaluator Agent**: This agent assesses the work of the executor agent and provides feedback.
- **Instruction for Evaluator Agent**: Provide the instruction for the evaluator agent to assess the executor's work and give feedback.

## Benefits of the Evaluator Optimizer Node



The Evaluator Optimizer Node offers several benefits, including:

- **Iterative Improvement**: Allows for continuous refinement of results based on feedback.
- **Quality Control**: Ensures that the final output meets high-quality standards through evaluation.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Facilitates a collaborative process between the executor and evaluator agents.

## Example Use Cases



The Evaluator Optimizer Node is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

- **Report Writing**: Imagine you are writing a report that consists of 10 specific sections. Sometimes, an agent may overlook one or two sections, but your report must include all 10 sections as previously defined. In this case, the evaluator agent can double-check the report to ensure that all 10 sections are present. If any sections are missing, the evaluator will provide refined feedback to the executor agent, prompting it to continue working until the report meets the criteria of having all 10 sections included.

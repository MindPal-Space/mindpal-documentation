# Router Node on MindPal Multi-Agent Workflow



The Router Node is a powerful component in MindPal Multi-Agent Workflow that enables you to classify an input and direct it to a specialized follow-up agent. This node allows for separation of concerns, making it easier to build more specialized workflows that cater to specific needs.

## What is a Router Node?



A Router Node is designed to handle complex tasks that involve distinct categories, each requiring separate handling by different downstream agents. By using a Router Node, you can optimize your workflow for multiple input types without compromising performance.

## Configuring a Router Node



To set up a Router Node on MindPal, you'll need to configure two essential components:

- **The Decision Logic**: Provide the instruction for the system to decide the next path. This logic determines how the input will be classified and which path to take.
- **The Path List**: Define a list of paths, each containing the next nodes and their descriptions. This allows you to specify the different routes that the input can take based on the decision logic.

## Benefits of the Router Node



The Router Node offers several benefits, including:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Handle different input types separately, making it easier to optimize and maintain your workflow.
- **Improved Performance**: Avoid compromising performance on one input type to optimize for another.
- **Flexibility**: Build more specialized workflows that cater to specific needs and requirements.

## Examples of Router Node Use Cases



The Router Node is particularly useful in scenarios where:

- **Directing Customer Service Queries**: Route different types of customer service queries (e.g., general questions, refund requests, technical support) to separate downstream agents.
- **Handling Multiple Input Types**: Optimize your workflow for multiple input types, such as text, images, or audio, without compromising performance.

By incorporating the Router Node into your MindPal Multi-Agent Workflow, you can create more efficient, flexible, and specialized workflows that drive business value.

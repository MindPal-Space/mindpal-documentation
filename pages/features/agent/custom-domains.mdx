## Setting Up Custom Domains

### Step 1: Connect Your Custom Domain

2.  Navigate to the setting page. It will be [https://brain.mindpal.space/personal/settings](https://brain.mindpal.space/personal/settings) in personal workspace and [https://brain.mindpal.space/\[TEAM\]/settings](https://brain.mindpal.space/personal/settings) in team workspace
    
3.  Click on "Add New Custom Domain"
    
4.  Enter your desired custom domain or subdomain
        

### Step 2: Configure DNS Settings

2.  Access your domain's DNS manager (through your domain registrar)
    
3.  Add the required DNS records as specified by MindPal
    
4.  Wait for DNS propagation to complete (this may take up to 48 hours)
    

### Step 3: Verify Domain Configuration

1.  Return to the custom domain settings in MindPal
    
2.  Check the domains table to verify your custom domain status
    
3.  Ensure the configuration shows as valid

4.  Choose your verified custom domain from the dropdown
    
5.  Define a specific path if desired (e.g., chatbot.yourdomain.com/support)
    
6.  Save your settings
    

### For AI Workflows

# Setting Up Knowledge Sources on MindPal


To establish a robust AI workforce on MindPal, it's essential to start with your knowledge sources. These data collections are crucial for your AI agents to operate effectively, just like humans need information to function. MindPal categorizes knowledge sources into two types: internal and external.

## Internal Knowledge Sources


Internal knowledge sources represent your business data collection, helping your AI agent understand your business context. You can fill up your internal knowledge sources using three easy methods:

- **Upload from Websites**: Add links from websites like your company's sites, blogs, YouTube videos, or any web content that matters to you.
- **Upload from Files**: Easily upload various file types such as PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel files, CSVs, EPUBs, audio clips, videos, and more.
- **Input Voice & Text**: Quickly type notes or record voice memos directly into MindPal to expand your data pool.

### Getting Started with Uploads


To begin uploading your knowledge sources to MindPal:

1. Navigate to either:
    - Personal workspace: https://app.mindpal.space/personal/knowledge-sources
    - Team workspace: [https://app.mindpal.space/[team-name]/knowledge-sources](https://app.mindpal.space/%5Bteam-name%5D/knowledge-sources)
2. Look for the blue upload button in the top right corner of the screen

### Advanced Configuration Options


When uploading knowledge sources, you can access advanced configuration settings to optimize how MindPal processes your content:

- **Chunk Size**: Determines the maximum size of each content segment when MindPal splits your knowledge source
- **Chunk Overlap**: Specifies how much overlap occurs between consecutive chunks to maintain context
- **Separators**: Defines special characters that guide the system in splitting your knowledge appropriately

These settings are optional but can be valuable when you need to customize how agents access and utilize your knowledge context. 
You can see how the configuration works in the following image:

# AI Agent: What it is

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a specialized AI assistant, employee, or specialist designed to perform a specific task. It's like having your own personal AI that focuses on solving a particular problem or completing a specific job.

In the past, it was not possible to have dedicated agents for every task. However, with the advancements in AI technology, we can now create and manage these agents to work on our behalf. We then become the leader, manager, or creator of these AI agents, who can design, control, and manage them to accomplish what they are supposed to do.

## Agent-first design on MindPal

AI Agents are at the heart of MindPal. Our platform is designed in a way to help you effortlessly build AI Agents that you can trust and easily incorporate them into your daily workflows.

With these AI Agents on MindPal, you can engage in chat conversations within a chat thread. You can also connect multiple AI Agents to formulate an AI Assembly to solve a big task. Additionally, you can summon these AI Agents to co-write with you in Smart Notes. Furthermore, you can publish any AI Agent as a chatbot for it to interact with external users on your behalf.

At MindPal, we believe an Agent-first approach is a valuable and effective way for integrating AI into work processes. By leveraging AI Agents, we can distill our expertise into these agents and delegate tasks to them to accomplish various activities. This not only saves time but also enables us to focus on higher-level cognitive tasks — what we are better at — such as critical thinking, planning, and pursuing ambitious goals. In a way, these AI Agents give us the freedom to think bigger and empower us to achieve greater results.

## Why we love the concept of Agent?

There are several reasons why agents are a valuable concept:

### 1. Intuitive

The idea of working with AI agents is intuitive, as we are used to collaborating with team members or employees. The only difference now is that instead of human agents, we have AI agents available 24/7, never tired, and fully adhering to our instructions.

### 2. Customizable

Agents are designed to be single-purpose, making it easier to customize and manage each agent according to its specific task. This allows for personalized instructions and settings that best fit the agent's purpose.

### 3. Flexible

AI agents can work individually or collaborate as an AI workflow, known as AI Assembly on MindPal. This flexibility enables agents to solve complex tasks by working together.

## Types of AI Agents

On MindPal, you have the freedom to create any type of agent you want. Ultimately, it's up to your imagination and visualization to build your own crew of AI agents to assist you in various tasks. Here are three common types:

### 1. Digital Twin

A digital twin is like a digital version of yourself. You can upload your knowledge, experiences, and insights as a knowledge source for the AI agent. It can have access to your unique knowledge and even be customized to have a similar personality. Think of it as a digital version of you that can interact with others.

### 2. Task-Based AI Agents

These agents are designed for specific tasks such as writing emails, creating blog posts, conducting market research, brainstorming ideas, or recommending books. Each agent focuses on a particular task to provide specialized assistance.

### 3. Character-Based AI Agents

These agents adopt a specific character and behave and talk like that person. They can be fictional characters or even real-life individuals. For example, you can have an AI agent that behaves like Doraemon. These agents serve the purpose of imitating a particular character.

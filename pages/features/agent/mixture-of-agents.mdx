## How to Use Mixture of Agents

### Step 1: Initiating Multiple Agents

In an agent thread, you can activate multiple agents by mentioning them using the @ symbol. This allows you to engage several AI models simultaneously for your task.

### Step 2: Setting Up Collaboration

Before clicking send button, you'll find a toggle option that allows you to combine the results from all the mentioned agents. This feature synthesizes the various outputs into a cohesive response.

### Step 3: Reviewing Combined Output

The final result will incorporate the best insights and responses from each agent, providing you with a more comprehensive solution to your query.

## Best Practices

1.  **Choose Complementary Agents**: Select agents with different LLM that complement each other for your specific task.
    
2.  **Clear Task Definition**: Provide clear instructions to ensure all agents understand the objective.
    
3.  **Review Individual Responses**: Before combining results, review individual agent responses to understand their unique contributions.

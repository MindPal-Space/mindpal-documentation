# Tool Feature on MindPal


The Tool feature on MindPal is a powerful functionality that enables your AI agent to connect with other tools and services via API. This allows your AI agent to access real-time data, interact with databases, and perform tasks that require external connections.

## What is the Tool Feature?


At its core, the AI agent is powered by a large language model that can generate text, images, or video output based on your input. However, this model has limitations, such as:

- Lack of real-time understanding of the market
- No direct access to databases
- Inability to push or add data into CRM systems

The Tool feature bridges this gap by allowing your AI agent to connect with external tools and services, expanding its capabilities and enabling it to perform tasks that require external interactions.

## Creating a Tool on MindPal


To connect your AI agent with a tool, you need to create a tool on MindPal first. This involves defining the API that the agent will use to connect with the tool. You can:

- Define the API from scratch if you have technical expertise
- Paste a sample API request into MindPal, and the system will automatically break it down into a tool for your AI agent

### Steps to Create a Tool:

1. **Define the API**: Specify the API endpoint, method, and parameters required to connect with the tool.
2. **Paste Sample API Request**: If you have a sample API request, paste it into MindPal, and the system will generate a tool for your AI agent.
3. **Configure Tool Settings**: Customize the tool settings as needed, such as authentication, data mapping, and error handling.

## Connecting a Tool to an AI Agent


Once you've created a tool on MindPal, you can connect it to your AI agent. This involves:

- **Selecting the Tool**: Choose the tool you created from the list of available tools.
- **Instructing the Agent**: Specify where and how the agent should use the tool, such as fetching data or sending notifications.

# What is a Chat Thread on MindPal?

A chat thread on MindPal is an interface that allows you to interact with your AI agents and knowledge sources. Let's dive into the key components and features of a chat thread.

## Agent - Your Personalized AI Assistant

In a chat thread, you have the option to assign an agent on MindPal to chat with. This agent is responsible for answering your queries and providing you with valuable insights. You can customize your agent based on your specific needs. For example, if you are working on business analysis or consulting tasks, you can summon a business analysis expert agent with preconfigured system instructions, model settings, and output settings that are best suited for the job. On the other hand, if you want to learn something new from a document, you can summon a tutor agent who is patient, considerate, and preconfigured with settings that enhance your learning experience. If you don't select an agent, the chat thread will continue with the default settings as a helpful generic AI assistant.

## Knowledge Sources - Enhancing Context and Relevance

When you are in a chat thread, you can connect it to different knowledge sources to provide the necessary context for meaningful conversations. MindPal supports three types of knowledge sources:

1. **Internal Knowledge Sources**: You can upload or import knowledge from third-party apps like Google Drive. This allows you to have access to your own documents and files within the chat thread.

2. **Smart Notes**: MindPal's smart notes feature enables you to create and reference your own notes during the conversation. This helps you capture important information and refer back to it later.

3. **External Knowledge Sources**: MindPal integrates with various external sources such as Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Arxiv, and more. By connecting the chat thread to these sources, you can tap into a vast pool of knowledge to enrich your discussions.

# AI Assembly: What it is

## Why AI Assembly?

After working with various AI models and integrating AI into our workflows, we have come to recognize a few limitations. Generative AI models like ChatGPT or Claude excel at producing results within a certain length, but struggle with long-form content such as writing research papers or performing complex analyses involving multiple tasks. Furthermore, these models are not well-suited for reasoning tasks, often producing generic results when forced to tackle a large task at once.

To overcome these limitations, we have adopted a best practice of breaking down tasks and having AI agents focus on one specific task at a time. This allows for customization and ensures the AI agent is best suited to solve that particular task.

However, up until now, our AI agents have only been able to work individually. There are instances where connecting multiple AI agents to collaborate on solving a larger task becomes necessary. Examples of such tasks include performing complicated research, writing comprehensive papers, or conducting complex reasoning for marketing campaigns or social media content pipelines.

That's when MindPal's AI Assembly feature comes into place.

## What is an AI Assembly?

AI assemblies are workflows that chain different AI agents together into an automated sequence. This sequence can be triggered with an input, and based on pre-configured steps, each step is carried out one by one to produce the final result. The chained agents can also pass input or data among each other, making the process collaborative and powerful.

## Why we love the concept of AI Assembly

There are several reasons why we love the AI assembly feature on MindPal:

1. **It is a natural development of our agent-first design.** After optimizing our MindPal to view AI agents as the primary focus, allowing them to work together feels like a natural progression.

2. **AI assemblies are intuitive.** Just as you can think of an agent as an employee, an assembly can be seen as a team or a process commonly performed at work. By defining processes and tasks into specific steps, you can automate them with an AI assembly.

3. **AI assembly unlocks numerous possibilities on MindPal, enabling AI agents to maximize their potential and abilities.** It allows us to automate highly specialized or complicated tasks involving multiple steps, while still ensuring the quality you require.

With AI assembly, we can now help you automate a wide range of tasks, no matter how specialized or complex they may be. Take a look and explore the possibilities that AI assembly offers on MindPal.

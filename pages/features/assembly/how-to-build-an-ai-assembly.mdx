# How to build an AI Assembly on MindPal

MindPal offers four ways for you to build an AI assembly: building from scratch, generating with AI, starting with a template, or importing from a JSON file. Each of these ways may have its own nuances, but they all come down to the basics of what constitutes an assembly on MindPal.

## Components of an AI Assembly

Before we dive into each way of building an AI assembly, let's first understand the components of an AI assembly on MindPal. Essentially, an AI assembly on MindPal will have three main components:

### 1. Trigger Input

Think of the trigger input as the input that will first be fed to the AI assembly to start the process. For example, if your AI assembly is about market research, the trigger input may be a short description of what your company is doing or the market in the industry you are in. MindPal currently offers four types of trigger input: text, file, and link, providing you with a great deal of flexibility.

### 2. Agents

The AI assembly is essentially a chain of AI agents, each specialized for a specific task and collaborating with each other in this chain. Before setting up your assembly, you will need to set up the agents necessary for the process. Think of this as the recruitment process of relevant and necessary employees to perform a project in your company.

### 3. Workflow

After you have the trigger input and the agents in place, it's time to connect them together into a workflow. Beginning with the trigger input, you can define each step and assign an agent to perform each step. Each step can get input from the trigger input itself or from the output of other steps, giving you flexibility and collaborative power for the assembly.

## Ways to Build an AI Assembly

Now that we understand the components of an AI assembly, let's explore the different ways to build one on MindPal:

### 1. Building from Scratch

If you are a pro user of MindPal, you have the customization power to build an AI assembly from scratch. This option allows you to prepare each component according to your specific needs.

### 2. Starting with a Template

MindPal also offers a collection of community templates shared by other users. You can browse through these templates and easily duplicate and customize them for your personal use. This option allows you to start faster and leverage the expertise of the MindPal community. To browse through all the community templates, please go [here](https://brain.mindpal.space/personal/agents?tab=assemblies&subTab=community).

### 3. Importing from a JSON File

For each AI assembly on MindPal, you have the option to export it as a JSON file. This makes it easy to save or share your AI assembly. You can simply click "New AI Assembly" and import the JSON file to have MindPal process it and create a fully working AI assembly.

### 4. Generating with AI

The most exciting and convenient way to build an AI assembly on MindPal is to generate it with AI. All you need to do is let us know what job needs to be done for the assembly, and our AI will help you plan the necessary steps to solve the job. You can then further edit the generated assembly for your personal use. This option is quick, easy, and highly efficient.

<div
  style={{
    marginTop: 24,
    position: "relative",
    width: "100%",
    paddingBottom: "56.25%",
  }}

  <iframe
    style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}

    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

We hope that with these flexible ways to build AI assemblies, you will feel more convenient and confident in building an AI assembly that you can trust and employ in your daily work.

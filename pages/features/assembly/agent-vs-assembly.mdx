# When to use Agent vs. Multi-Agent Assembly?

## Answer

If the job to be done satisfies any of these criteria, you should build an assembly for that job, instead of just one single agent:

1. You expect the result to be long + in great detail.
2. The final result is expected to be well-structured and can be broken down to distinct steps.
3. The prompt for the agent would be too long/complicated to manage if the whole job is to be done by just one agent.

## Explanation

Both agents and multi-agent assemblies provide you a way to create automation engines that can be reused multiple times for different context at hand, to help you get things done faster.

However, since an assembly is a CHAIN that involves multiple steps, which can be executed by a different agent, instead of just one agent, it is more well-versed to perform complex tasks.

Understanding this difference and choosing the suitable kind of "engine" for your task will surely help you get better responses, hence more value from MindPal.

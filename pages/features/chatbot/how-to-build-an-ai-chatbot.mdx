# How to Build an AI Chatbot on MindPal

Building an AI chatbot on MindPal is a straightforward process that involves several key steps. In this guide, we will walk you through each section of the chatbot creation space to help you create your own AI chatbot.

## 1. General Information

The first step is to specify the general information of the chatbot. This includes giving your chatbot a name, selecting an avatar photo, and providing a short description of what the chatbot is about. This information helps users understand what they can expect from the chatbot.

## 2. Functional Settings

Functional settings power the function of the chatbot. There are two main aspects to consider:

- **Agent**: Select an AI agent from your team of AI agents on MindPal. Choose an agent that aligns with the purpose of your chatbot. For example, if your chatbot is for customer support, select a customer support agent that is helpful and knowledgeable about your product or service. If your chatbot is a teaching assistant, choose a tutor or teaching assistant agent.

- **Knowledge Sources**: Connect your chatbot with internal knowledge sources like smart notes or external sources like Google, Wikipedia, or YouTube. This allows your chatbot to provide accurate and relevant information based on the task at hand.

## 3. User Info Collection (Optional)

If you need to gather specific information from users, you can enable user info collection. This feature prompts users to fill out a form after each message from the chatbot. Customize the form title and add fields as needed, such as email or name, to facilitate follow-up or user tracking.

## 4. Chat Interface (Optional)

The chat interface section allows you to customize the look and feel of your MindPal chatbot. While default settings are available, you can further customize:

- The initial message of the chatbot

- The send message button text

- The message input placeholder text

- The info form submit button text (if user info collection is enabled)

- The ability to hide MindPal branding (for paid users)

## 5. Access and Security (Optional)

The access and security section helps you configure how people can access your chatbot and secure its usage to prevent abuse. You can:

- Customize the chatbot's slug, which is by default your chatbot's ID, to a unique, human-readable, and meaningful string

- Enable a custom domain for your chatbot

- Restrict embedding and iframing to specific domains to prevent unauthorized use

## 6. API Keys (Optional)

The API keys section is relevant if you use specific features not provided by MindPal by default. Depending on your plan and chatbot settings, you may need to input API keys to power certain functionalities. Examples include using an LLM model from OpenRouter (requiring an OpenRouter API key) or utilizing Google search as a knowledge source (requiring a SERP API key). This feature allows you to have dedicated API keys for different chatbots, especially useful when creating chatbots for different purposes or clients. You will find out if you need to enter the API keys if you are asked to do so in the chatbot creation area. If you don't see this section, you don't have to provide any API keys.

These are the main sections involved in creating a chatbot on MindPal. In most cases, providing general information and configuring functional settings are sufficient. However, if you want your chatbot to be more advanced, you can explore the latter four sections to further customize its behavior and appearance.

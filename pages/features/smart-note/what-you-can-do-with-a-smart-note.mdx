# What you can do with an AI Smart Note on MindPal

With the help of artificial intelligence, MindPal's smart notes offer a range of capabilities that can revolutionize your writing experience, helping you to write faster and better. Let's explore some of the ways smart notes on MindPal can assist you:

## 1. Audio Notes

MindPal's smart notes come equipped with a built-in speech recognition feature. This means you can simply speak out loud and have the smart note transform your raw voice and speech into polished and refined notes. Speaking is often more convenient and faster than writing, making this feature incredibly handy. Whether it's an email, a blog post, a help document like this one, or a social media post, MindPal's AI agent can assist you in the writing process.

## 2. AI Writing Agents

With MindPal's smart notes, you have the ability to assign specific AI agents to help you write. This means you can have different AI writing agents for different tasks, each with pre-configured instructions, knowledge sources, and settings tailored to excel in that specific task. Whether you need an email writing agent, a research paper agent, or a business analysis agent, MindPal has got you covered. By giving your specific requirements upfront, you can save time on editing and be confident that your AI agent will deliver the desired output.

## 3. Referring to Knowledge Sources

MindPal's smart notes allow you to refer to your knowledge sources while you're writing. This means you have access to both your internal knowledge sources and external ones like Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, and more. By having the full context at its disposal, the AI agent can write faster and provide you with more relevant and meaningful output for your specific situation.

## 4. Content Editing with AI

Not only can AI agents help you generate the initial draft faster, but they can also assist in refining the content. MindPal offers a built-in editing with AI feature that allows you to select a certain part of the smart note that you would like to modify. You can then command the AI agent to make the necessary edits, either by writing it down or speaking out loud. This saves you time on writing specific words and puts you in the position of commanding and proofreading for the final output, speeding up your writing process.

# Knowledge Source: What it is

When using MindPal, you have the ability to provide knowledge sources to your agents.

## What exactly is a knowledge source?

In simple terms, it is a source of knowledge that you can provide to your agents for more effective results.

## Why knowledge sources matter?

Knowledge sources are crucial on MindPal because they provide the ability for you to control and customize the information available to each agent.

MindPal's AI comes with common knowledge by default, but by tailoring the available knowledge for each agent, they can perform their duties more effectively.

For example, a market research agent may require access to Google data to gather relevant information and insights. On the other hand, a blog writer agent may need access to your company description to accurately represent your organization in their writing.

## Types of knowledge sources

MindPal supports two main types of knowledge sources: internal and external.

### 1. Internal Knowledge Sources

Internal knowledge sources are the ones you can directly upload to MindPal. Here are the different types:

- **Documents**: MindPal supports various document types including PDF, EPUB, PowerPoint, Docs, Excel, and even video and audio files.

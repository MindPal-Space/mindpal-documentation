This means that the response you receive is not generic or generalized but is instead customized based on the knowledge obtained from the referred source.

### 4. Chatbots

If you publish a chatbot, you can connect knowledge sources to it. This gives the chatbot access to the information contained within those sources. As a result, the chatbot can provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 5. Plug-ins

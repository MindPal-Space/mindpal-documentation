# Smart notes as a knowledge source

## Why using smart notes as a knowledge source

When using MindPal as your second brain, you have the option to upload documents or websites as knowledge sources. However, these sources are considered persistent data, which means it can be challenging to keep them updated. You would need to make changes elsewhere and then reupload them into MindPal, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially when dealing with a large amount of data.

Fortunately, MindPal offers a solution called "Smart Notes." These notes are powered by AI and come in the form of a Notion-style text editor. They serve as your working memory for your second brain, allowing you to capture and edit ideas anytime you want.

## What makes smart notes a wonderful knowledge source

### 1. Easy and Convenient Idea Capture

With Smart Notes, capturing your thoughts and ideas is a breeze. Instead of having to jot them down in another application or window, you are just one click away from capturing them directly in MindPal. This saves you time and eliminates the need to upload them again.

### 2. Real-Time Updates

Smart Notes allow you to keep your data updated whenever you want. If you need to make changes or edits, simply go to the specific note and update the information. MindPal, your AI second brain, will always have the latest information available. This is particularly useful for scenarios like a customer service chatbot. By storing frequently asked questions in Smart Notes, you can easily add, remove, or edit questions and answers in real-time, ensuring your chatbot always has the most up-to-date information.

### 3. Unified Data

MindPal's Smart Notes bring all your data together in one place. You no longer need to create separate knowledge sources and upload them individually. By utilizing Smart Notes, you can have a comprehensive second brain that includes both persistent data from documents or websites and a flexible working memory that can be easily changed and updated.

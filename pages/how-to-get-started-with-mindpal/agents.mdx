# Checkpoint 3/6 â€” Agents

Once your knowledge sources are set up, the next step is to create your AI agents, envisioned as your virtual AI employees or assistants. Let's walk through the essential steps to establish and enhance these AI companions efficiently.

## 4 Essential Steps

### Step 1: Naming Your Agent

To give your AI agent an identity, start by assigning a name or any unique identifier. This helps you easily distinguish and communicate with your agent.

### Step 2: Providing Agent Background & Desired Format

Define your agent's role and responsibilities by outlining its background, akin to a job description. Specify who the agent is, its tasks, how it operates, and insights from your knowledge that can aid its performance. You can also specify the desired format for the agent's responses to ensure consistency.

### Step 3: Linking Knowledge Sources

Equip your AI agents with contextual information by connecting them to internal or external knowledge sources previously uploaded. This enables them to execute tasks effectively using relevant data.

### Step 4: Selecting LLM Model

Choose the appropriate Large Language Model (LLM) that will power your AI agent. Different models offer varying capabilities and strengths:

*   Each model has specific strengths for different types of tasks
    
*   Models consume different amounts of credits per usage
    
*   Consider the balance between performance needs and credit consumption
    

## Advanced Options

# Checkpoint 3/6 — Agents

Once your knowledge sources are set up, the next step is to create your AI agents, envisioned as your virtual AI employees or assistants. Let's walk through the essential steps to establish and enhance these AI companions efficiently.

## 3 Essential Steps

### Step 1: Naming Your Agent

To give your AI agent an identity, start by assigning a name or any unique identifier. This helps you easily distinguish and communicate with your agent.

### Step 2: Providing Agent Background

Define your agent's role and responsibilities by outlining its background, akin to a job description. Specify who the agent is, its tasks, how it operates, and insights from your knowledge that can aid its performance.

### Step 3: Linking Knowledge Sources\*\*

Equip your AI agents with contextual information by connecting them to internal or external knowledge sources previously uploaded. This enables them to execute tasks effectively using relevant data.

### Step 5: Styles for Unique Responses

Tailor your agent's responses to match specific styles, such as mimicking your voice or company's tone.

### Step 6: Training Examples for Continuous Improvement

Provide quality examples for your AI agents to learn from, improving their performance over time by remembering successful interactions.

## Leveraging Templates and AI Generation

# **Introduction to Multi-Agent Workflow on MindPal**


Multi-Agent Workflow is a powerful feature designed to help you automate complex business processes by connecting multiple AI agents together. This feature enables you to build customized workflows that streamline tasks, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity.

## **What is Multi-Agent Workflow?**



Multi-Agent Workflow is a feature that allows you to create a sequence of tasks that are performed by multiple AI agents. These agents can work together in various ways, such as:

- **Sequentially**: Like an assembly line, where each agent completes a task before passing it on to the next agent.
- **Task assignment**: One agent initiates a task and assigns it to other agents for completion.
- **Loops**: Agents can perform the same task on a list of items, automating repetitive processes.
- **Optimization**: One agent can continuously refine and optimize results until they meet a specific criteria.

## **Workflow Nodes**


In MindPal's Multi-Agent Workflow, different nodes represent various ways that AI agents can work together. These nodes are the building blocks of your workflow, and you can configure them to create a customized process that suits your business needs.

# Checkpoint 5/6 — Workflows

In your journey of leveraging AI agents on MindPal for various work tasks, you may encounter complex processes that require multiple steps beyond the capacity of a single agent. While individual agents excel at specific tasks, there are scenarios where a collaborative approach is needed to tackle more intricate workflows effectively.

Imagine scenarios where crafting a comprehensive social media campaign involves creating distinct posts for various platforms or generating holistic feedback for a student essay across different facets. These scenarios share one common trait: They involve multiple steps that could be standardized into a process. This is where MindPal's Multi-Agent Workflow steps in.

Imagine a series of interconnected AI agents collaborating fluidly to tackle tasks that surpass the limits of a standalone agent.

## How to build a workflow

Creating a multi-agent workflow consists of two key elements:

### 1. Trigger Input

The trigger input initiates the workflow, accepting text files or URLs to kickstart the process. You can define as many fields as you want to.

### 2. Workflow Steps

Once the trigger input is established, you can incorporate specific steps into the workflow. You can add as many steps as needed, assigning agents to carry out each step and defining the task for them. Tasks can reference input values or outputs from previous steps, facilitating a seamless flow of data among agents.

## Easy starter methods

Crafting a workflow from scratch may seem daunting due to its complexity. To simplify this process, MindPal offers pre-designed templates that can be duplicated. You can even generate an entire workflow using AI. Just outline the purpose of the workflow, and let MindPal effortlessly craft the first version for you so you could iterate from there.

## Run your workflow

Once your AI workflows are set up, you can execute them anytime, anywhere by inputting the requisite values in the trigger input and start the operation. Each step in the workflow executes sequentially, giving the comprehensive result you need.

## Share your workflow

You can also your workflows with others via a shareable link, enabling anyone to utilize the workflow without an account on MindPal. All executed workflows are conveniently stored for quick access and overview.

And that’s a wrap! You’ve just mastered how to leverage MindPal for 10x productivity at work! Congratulations on learning about MindPal. Now it’s your turn to build your own AI second brain on MindPal, and leverage it for your work!

# Checkpoint 4/6 — Chatbots

As you build and work with your AI agents, there may come a time when you need to share them with others. For instance, you might wish to deploy an AI customer service agent to handle user queries or an AI tutor to assist students. In such scenarios, building a chatbot becomes essential—a publishable and shareable version of your AI agent.

To create a chatbot, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Provide General Information

Name your chatbot, set a profile picture, and offer a brief description to help users understand its purpose.

### Step 2: Configure Functional Settings

Assign the AI agent that will power the chatbot and determine the necessary knowledge sources to train the chatbot on.

### Step 3: Optimize for Sharing

- Enable user info collection to gather relevant data from users interacting with the chatbot.
- Customize the chat interface to improve user navigation.
- Configure access and security settings, including customizing the chatbot's URL, enabling deployment on your website with a custom domain, or restricting the sharing of the chatbot on certain domains to avoid abuse.

### Step 4: Publish and Share

Once the chatbot is set up, publish it and share it through public links, embeddable iframes, or chat bubble widgets on websites.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Managing the Chatbot

As your chatbot engages with external users, you can view conversation logs and user data to monitor interactions effectively.

In the next post, you’ll learn another powerful way of working with your AI agents.

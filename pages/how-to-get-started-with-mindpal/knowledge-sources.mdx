# Checkpoint 2/6 — Knowledge Sources

To set up your AI workforce on MindPal, let's start with your knowledge sources. Just like humans need information to function, your AI agents also require data to operate effectively. MindPal refers to these data collections as knowledge sources, divided into two categories: internal and external.

## Internal Knowledge Sources

Internal knowledge sources represent your personal data collection, helping your AI buddy understand your world. Here's how you can fill up your internal knowledge sources using 3 easy methods:

1. **Upload from Websites:** Add links from websites like your company's sites, blogs, YouTube videos, or any web content that matters to you.
2. **Upload from Files:** Easily upload various file types such as PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel files, CSVs, EPUBs, audio clips, videos, and more.
3. **Input Voice & Text:** Quickly type notes or record voice memos directly into MindPal to expand your data pool.

### Getting Started with Uploads

To begin uploading your knowledge sources to MindPal:
1. Navigate to either:
   - Personal workspace: https://brain.mindpal.space/personal/knowledge-sources
   - Team workspace: https://brain.mindpal.space/[team-name]/knowledge-sources
2. Look for the blue upload button in the top right corner of the screen

### Advanced Configuration Options

When uploading knowledge sources, you can access advanced configuration settings to optimize how MindPal processes your content:

- **Chunk Size:** Determines the maximum size of each content segment when MindPal splits your knowledge source
- **Chunk Overlap:** Specifies how much overlap occurs between consecutive chunks to maintain context
- **Separators:** Defines special characters that guide the system in splitting your knowledge appropriately

These settings are optional but can be valuable when you need to customize how agents access and utilize your knowledge context.

## External Knowledge Sources

External knowledge sources involve data from sources outside your personal collection. This includes info from search engines like Google, educational sites like Wikipedia, video platforms like YouTube, research databases like RSIF, and similar online resources.

By combining internal and external knowledge sources, your AI agents—whom you'll create next—will have the essential info and context required to carry out tasks effectively. With your knowledge sources ready, you're all set to move on to building your customized AI agents.

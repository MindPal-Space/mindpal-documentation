### Context Window
The maximum amount of text a language model can process in a single request, including both input and output.

### Custom Domain
Your own domain (e.g., chat.yourcompany.com) used to host published chatbots and workflow forms instead of MindPal's default URLs.

### Custom Session Context
User-specific information passed from your website to chatbots/workflows for personalized interactions. See [Custom Session Context Guide](/guides/custom-session-context).

### Custom User ID
A unique identifier passed to chatbots to enable conversation history and user tracking. See [Custom User ID Guide](/guides/custom-user-id).

## E

### Editor Seat
A workspace member role with full permissions to create, edit, and manage agents, workflows, and assets.

### Embed Code
HTML/JavaScript code that allows you to add chatbots or workflow forms to your website.

### Evaluator-Optimizer Node
A workflow node that iteratively improves output by evaluating quality and regenerating until meeting specified criteria.

## F

### Form
A published workflow that presents a user-friendly interface for running workflows outside of MindPal. See [Running Workflows via Form](/workflow/run/form).

## G

### Gate Node
A workflow node that enforces stopping conditions and halts execution when specified criteria are met. See [Gate Node](/workflow/build/gate-node).

## H

### Human Input Node
A workflow node that collects various types of input from users, including text, files, images, and selections. See [Human Input Node](/workflow/build/human-input-node).

## I

### Info Node
A workflow node that displays information to users and requires acknowledgment before continuing. See [Info Node](/workflow/build/info-node).

## K

### Knowledge Source
Documents, URLs, or images uploaded to MindPal that agents can reference when generating responses. See [Knowledge Sources](/agent/knowledge-sources).

## L

### Language Model (LLM)
The AI model that powers an agent's reasoning and text generation. Options include models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. See [Language Model Settings](/agent/language-model).

### Loop Node
A workflow node that automatically performs a task across multiple items in a list. See [Loop Node](/workflow/build/loop-node).

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
An open protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and services using server URLs. See [Model Context Protocol](/agent/mcp).

### Memory
An agent's ability to store and recall information from previous conversations and interactions.

### Multi-Agent Workflow
A workflow system that connects multiple agents to handle complex, multi-step processes. See [Introduction to Multi-Agent Workflows](/workflow).

## N

### Node
A building block in a workflow that performs a specific function. Types include Agent, Human Input, Loop, Router, and more.

### Notes
Dynamic, editable text entries that serve as persistent memory for agents. See [Notes](/agent/notes).

## O

### Orchestrator-Worker Node
A workflow node that coordinates multiple worker agents for complex tasks requiring autonomous planning. See [Orchestrator-Worker Node](/workflow/build/orchestrator-worker-node).

## P

### Payment Node
A workflow node that collects payments through Stripe during workflow execution. See [Payment Node](/workflow/build/payment-node).

### Prompt
Instructions given to an AI agent or within a workflow node that define what task to perform.

### Public API
MindPal's REST API for programmatically triggering workflows and retrieving results. See [Public API Trigger](/workflow/trigger/api).

## R

### Rate Limiting
Controls that limit how many requests users can make to your published chatbots or workflows. See [Rate Limiting Guide](/guides/rate-limit).

### Router Node
A workflow node that switches execution between different paths based on conditions. See [Router Node](/workflow/build/router-node).

## S

### Scheduled Trigger
A workflow trigger that automatically runs workflows at specified times or intervals. See [Schedule Trigger](/workflow/trigger/schedule).

### Sticky Note Node
A non-executable workflow node used for adding documentation and notes within the workflow canvas.

### Sub-agent
An agent that works under another agent to handle delegated tasks. See [Sub-agent](/agent/sub-agent).

### Subflow Node
A workflow node that runs another workflow as a step within the current workflow. See [Subflow Node](/workflow/build/subflow-node).

### Supervised Mode
A workflow run mode where users review and approve each step before proceeding to the next.

### System Instructions
The core configuration of an agent that defines its behavior, background, and output format. See [System Instructions](/agent/system-instructions).

## T

### Temperature
A setting that controls how creative or deterministic an AI model's responses are. Higher values produce more varied output.

### Tool
An external integration that allows agents to access data or perform actions beyond text generation. See [Tools](/agent/tools).

### Trigger
A mechanism that starts workflow execution, including manual, API, scheduled, and form triggers.

## U

### User Seat
A workspace member role with run-only access to agents and workflows, without creation or editing permissions.

## V

### Variable

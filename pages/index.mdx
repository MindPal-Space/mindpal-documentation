# Quick Start Guide

MindPal is a platform for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows to automate business processes.

Whether you need a single AI assistant or a team of AI agents working together, we've got you covered. Your agents will understand your business and get things done exactly how you want them to.

Let's get you started with the basics.

## Agents - AI Specialists

Think of agents as your AI team members who are always ready to help. Each one can be trained to handle specific tasks just the way you want.

### Creating Your Agent

You have 3 simple ways to start:

1. **Let AI do the work**: Tell us what you need, and we'll set up an agent for you
2. **Use a template**: Pick from our pre-made agents and tweak them to fit your needs
3. **Start fresh**: Build your agent from scratch with full control

Make your agent work better for you by:

- Giving it a clear role and setting how you want the results
- Choosing from top AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and more)
- Training it to match your company's style
- Adding your documents so it understands your business
- Connecting it to other tools to get data or take actions

### Using Your Agent

Once ready, you can:

- Chat with your agent right away
- Share it with your team so everyone can use it
- Make it public as a chatbot that anyone can use through a link or on your website

## Multi-Agent Workflows - SOPs for AI Agents

Sometimes you need multiple agents working together on complex tasks. That's where workflows come in - they're like your AI assembly line, where each agent handles its part of the job.

### Creating Your Workflow

Just like with agents, you have 3 ways to start:

1. **Let AI do the work**: Explain your process, and we'll set up the workflow
2. **Use a template**: Pick from our pre-made workflows and adjust them
3. **Start fresh**: Design your workflow from scratch

Make your workflow more powerful by:

- Letting agents share information through variables
- Using smart AI features like self-planning and self-improvement
- Adding human checkpoints for important decisions

### Using Your Workflow

Once ready, you can:

- Run it anytime with your inputs
- Share it with your team
- Make it public as a form that anyone can use through a link or on your website

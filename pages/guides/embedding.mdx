# Embedding Chatbots & Workflows

A comprehensive guide to embedding your MindPal chatbots and workflows on your website or platform.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";
import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

## What is Embedding?

Embedding allows you to integrate your MindPal chatbots and workflows directly into your website, platform, or application. Instead of sending users to a separate MindPal page, they can interact with your AI tools right where they already are - creating a seamless, branded experience.

## What Can Be Embedded?

- **Published Chatbots**: [AI agents](/agent) published as [interactive chatbots](/agent/chatbot)
- **Published Workflows**: [Multi-agent workflows](/workflow) published as [interactive forms](/workflow/run/form)

Both types can be embedded using the same methods, though some features may vary.

## How Embedding Works

When you publish a chatbot or workflow in MindPal, you get:

1. **A unique URL** - A shareable link that anyone can access
2. **Embedding code** - HTML/JavaScript code you can add to your website
3. **Customization options** - Control over appearance, behavior, and security

The embedding process involves three main steps:

1. **Publish** your chatbot or workflow in MindPal
2. **Copy** the embedding code from the publish modal
3. **Paste** the code into your website where you want it to appear

## Embedding Methods

MindPal offers three main methods for embedding your chatbots and workflows. Each has different use cases and benefits.

| Method              | Best For                                   | How It Works                                                         | When to Use                                                              | Pros                                                                                              | Cons                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct Links**    | Email campaigns, navigation menus, buttons | Shareable URL that opens a full-page view                            | Email campaigns, navigation menus, social media sharing                  | Simple (just copy/paste URL), works everywhere, no code required, full-page experience            | Users leave your website, less integrated feeling, limited customization                          |
| **Iframe Embed**    | Embedding as a section on a specific page  | HTML iframe element displays chatbot/workflow as a contained section | Dedicated support pages, member dashboards, product pages, landing pages | Fully integrated, maintains site navigation, can be styled, supports advanced features            | Requires HTML editing access, takes up page space, may need responsive design                     |
| **Floating Widget** | Site-wide chat buttons (chatbots only)     | Floating chat button in bottom-right corner opens overlay            | Customer support, site-wide AI assistance, lead generation               | Doesn't take up space until opened, available on every page, familiar interface, can be minimized | Only for chatbots (not workflows), requires JavaScript, may conflict with other floating elements |

### Direct Links

<script>
  window.mindpalIframeConfig = {
    "my-chatbot": {
      customUserId: "USER_123", // Replace with actual user ID
      customSessionContext: {
        "customer-name": "John Doe",
        "account-type": "premium",
        "order-id": "12345",

    },
  };
</script>
<script
  src="https://chatbot.getmindpal.com/iframe.min.js"
  data-target="my-chatbot"
></script>
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Use the simple version if your chatbot doesn't have [custom user
  ID](/guides/custom-user-id) or [custom session
  context](/guides/custom-session-context) enabled. The advanced version is
  required when you need to pass user identification or contextual information
  to your chatbot.

      customSessionContext: {
        "customer-name": "John Doe",
        "account-type": "premium",
      },
    },

## Advanced Features

MindPal embedding supports powerful advanced features that let you create personalized, context-aware experiences. These features are covered in detail in specialized guides, but here's an overview:

### Custom User ID

**What it does:** Identifies individual users so your chatbot or workflow can remember their conversations and provide personalized experiences.

**Key benefits:** Conversation history per user, personalized interactions, user-specific tracking, better integration with your user system.

**Quick setup:** Enable "[Custom User ID](/guides/custom-user-id)" in your chatbot/workflow settings, choose a mode (Optional or Required), and pass the user ID from your website when embedding.

**Example:**

```html
<script>
  window.mindpalConfig = {
    chatbotId: "your-chatbot",
    customUserId: "USER_123", // Pass your user's ID here
  };
</script>
```

**Learn more:** See the [Custom User ID guide](/guides/custom-user-id) for detailed instructions, platform-specific examples, and troubleshooting.

### Custom Session Context

**What it does:** Passes contextual information about your users (name, account type, order details, etc.) to your chatbot or workflow so the AI already knows relevant details without asking.

**Key benefits:** Personalized greetings and responses, context-aware conversations, no need for users to repeat information, seamless integration with your existing data.

**Quick setup:** Enable "[Custom Session Context](/guides/custom-session-context)" in your chatbot/workflow settings, define context keys (e.g., "Customer Name", "Account Type"), and pass context values from your website when embedding.

**Example:**

```html
<script>
  window.mindpalConfig = {
    chatbotId: "your-chatbot",
    customSessionContext: {
      "customer-name": "John Doe",
      "account-type": "premium",
      "order-id": "12345",
    },
  };
</script>
```

**Learn more:** See the [Custom Session Context guide](/guides/custom-session-context) for detailed instructions, platform-specific examples, and security best practices.

## Platform-Specific Instructions

MindPal provides optimized embedding instructions for popular platforms. When you use the "Share & Embed" feature, you can select your platform to get customized code.

### Supported Platforms

When you select a platform, you'll get platform-optimized code, specific instructions for that platform, automatic mapping of user data fields (where supported), and platform-specific best practices.

## Security & Access Control

### Domain Restrictions

**What it does:** Prevents unauthorized websites from embedding your chatbot or workflow.

**How to enable:** Go to your chatbot/workflow settings, navigate to "Access & Security" or "Control access", enable "Embedding Restrictions", and add your allowed domains (one per line).

**Example:**

```
yourwebsite.com
app.yourwebsite.com
*.yourwebsite.com
```

**Why it matters:** Without domain restrictions, anyone could embed your chatbot on their website, potentially using your AI credits or creating a poor user experience.

### Rate Limiting

**What it does:** Controls how many requests users can make to prevent abuse and manage costs.

**How to enable:** Go to your chatbot/workflow settings, navigate to "Access & Security", and configure rate limit rules with different scopes (Global, Per IP, Per user, Per session). Set maximum requests and time window for each rule.

**Example:** Maximum requests: 50, Time window: 1 hour, Scope: Per IP address. This means each IP address can make 50 requests per hour. You can configure multiple rules with different scopes and time windows for flexible rate limiting.

**Learn more:** See the [Rate Limit guide](/guides/rate-limit) for detailed configuration options.

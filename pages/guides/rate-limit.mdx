# Rate Limiting for Published Agents & Workflows

Protect your AI agents and workflows from abuse, control costs, and ensure fair usage for all users.

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate Limiting is a security and control feature that allows you to define the maximum number of requests a user can make to your Chatbot or Published Workflow within a specific time period.

Think of it as a "speed limit" for your AI agents. It ensures that no single user (or bot) can overwhelm your system by sending too many messages or running too many workflows in a short amount of time.

## Key Benefits

For business users, setting up Rate Limits is crucial for three main reasons:

-   **Cost Control**: Every interaction with your AI agent consumes resources (AI credits). If a malicious user or a bot spams your chatbot, it could drain your credits very quickly. Rate limits stop this from happening.
-   **Fair Usage**: It ensures that your service remains available and fast for all your customers. By preventing one user from hogging all the resources, you guarantee a smooth experience for everyone else.
-   **Security**: It protects your public-facing agents from "Denial of Service" attacks where attackers try to crash your system by flooding it with requests.

## Setting Up Rate Limits

You can configure Rate Limits directly in the settings of your Chatbot or Workflow.

### For Chatbots

1.  Go to your Chatbot Builder.
2.  Navigate to the **Advanced** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the **Rate Limiting** section.
4.  You will see a "Rate Limit Rules" builder.
5.  Click "Add Custom Rule" to define your own limits.

### For Workflows

1.  Go to your Workflow Editor.
2.  Open the **Publish Settings** panel (usually the gear icon).
3.  Find the **Rate Limiting** section in the Advanced settings.
4.  Use the builder to add or modify rules.

### Configuring a Rule

When adding a rule, you can choose:

-   **Scope**: Who does this limit apply to?
    -   **Global**: Total requests allowed for the entire agent (across all users).
    -   **Per IP**: Limit requests per IP address (good for stopping spam from a specific location).
    -   **Per Session**: Limit requests per browser session.
    -   **Per User ID**: Limit requests per specific user (requires [Custom User ID](/guides/custom-user-id) to be enabled).
-   **Max Requests**: How many requests are allowed (e.g., 50).
-   **Time Window**: The time period for the limit (e.g., "Per Hour", "Per Day").

## Best Practices & Considerations

-   **Default Protection**: By default, MindPal may apply a "Standard Protection" (e.g., 100 requests/day) to keep your agent safe if you haven't configured anything.
-   **Multiple Rules**: You can have multiple rules active at the same time. For example, you can set a strict limit per IP (to stop spammers) and a generous Global limit (to manage overall budget). The system will block a request if *any* of the rules are violated.
-   **Custom User ID**: The "Per User ID" scope is powerful for identifying logged-in users in your own app, but it only works if you have enabled and integrated [Custom User ID](/guides/custom-user-id) in your embedding settings.
-   **User Experience**: When a user hits the limit, they will receive an error message telling them to try again later. Make sure your limits aren't too strict for legitimate business usage.
